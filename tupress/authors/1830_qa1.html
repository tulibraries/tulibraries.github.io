            <p><strong>A Q&A with co-author Ray Didinger about his favorite team,

              <em>The Eagles Encyclopedia</em> </strong></td>

		<tr>
          <td colspan="2"><p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>When did you see your first 
              Eagles game, and how did you become a lifelong fan? Do you </i></em>ever<em> 
              miss a game? </em><br>
              <strong> A:</strong> The first actual Eagles game I ever attended 
              was the home opener in 1956. The Eagles played Washington in a downpour 
              at Connie Mack Stadium. But I was following the Eagles long before 
              that. My parents were such huge fans that when my father took his 
              two-week summer vacation, we went to the Eagles training camp, which 
              was then in Hershey, PA. Who needs the Jersey shore when you can 
              watch the Eagles go through two-a-days? 
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Did you ever have dreams to play pro football, 
              or, coach the Eagles? Or do you prefer just to watch and root for 
              the team?</em> <br>
              <strong> A:</strong> As a youngster, I had dreams of being another 
              Tommy McDonald. He was my boyhood idol. But I soon came to realize 
              I was better suited to the press box than the field. 
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>What player do you most admire? Who in 
              your opinion is the most underrated athlete on the team? Who on 
              the current roster do you expect we'll be celebrating in the years 
              to come? </em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> I admire David Akers for his perseverance to 
              keep going after being released by three other NFL teams and signing 
              with the Eagles to become the best kicker in team history. He truly 
              made it the hard way. In my opinion, the most underrated player 
              is cornerback Sheldon Brown. He was the one starter in the secondary 
              that <i>didn't</i> go to the Pro Bowl last season, yet he certainly 
              was deserving. He is an outstanding young corner with a very bright 
              future. The player we will be celebrating is Donovan McNabb. He 
              already has led the Eagles to more post-season appearances than 
              any quarterback in franchise history and as we saw last season, 
              he is still improving. I fully expect him to win a Super Bowl for 
              the Eagles. 
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Which Eagle player/coach from the past 
              that is no longer alive would you have liked to have interviewed 
              or seen play?</em> <br>
              <strong> A:</strong> I've had the good fortune to interview most 
              of the coaches and players from the last 60 years, including the 
              stars from the 1948-49 championship teams, such as Steve Van Buren, 
              Pete Pihos and Chuck Bednarik. I didn't see those teams play, but 
              I've certainly seen the films and in my opinion, they were one of 
              the great teams of all-time. Van Buren looks like a 1940s version 
              of John Riggins, a stunning combination of speed and power. I wish 
              I could have interviewed Greasy Neale, the coach because he was 
              such a brilliant football mind and also a colorful character. 
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Is there a personal highlight in the 30-plus 
              years you spent covering the Eagles?<br>
              </em><strong>A:</strong> That's easy. It would be August 1, 1998, 
              when I presented Tommy McDonald for induction into the Pro Football 
              Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. It was an incredible feeling, standing 
              on the steps of the Hall of Fame, delivering the presentation speech 
              for the man who was my boyhood idol. It was one of the great thrills 
              of my life. I was honored beyond words that Tommy allowed me to 
              be a part of that glorious weekend. 
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em></i> </em>The Eagles Encyclopedia<em> contains 
              some pretty wild stories such as the one about Adrian Burk's seven 
              touchdown day, or Donovan McNabb passing for four TDs with a broken 
              ankle. How did you research/discover these amazing anecdotes, and 
              which is your favorite? </em><br>
              <strong> A:</strong> In the course of writing about the Eagles for 
              <i>The Philadelphia Bulletin</i> and <i>The Philadelphia Daily News</i> 
              for 27 years, I either covered those stories as they happened or 
              I researched them for various anniversary tributes. My favorite 
              was the 17-sack game by defensive end Norm (Wildman) Willey in 1952. 
              To this day, many people think it is a myth because the NFL did 
              not start counting sacks as an official statistic until 1982, but 
              it really did happen. Back then, the Eagles coaches gave the defensive 
              players a $10 bonus for each hit they put on the quarterback. That 
              week, Willey recalls getting an envelope with $170 in it. "I felt 
              like I was rich," he said. It truly was a different era. 
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>The sidelines chapter in the book is great 
              fun&#151;the names and nicknames, the top 5 touchdown celebrations 
              by T.O.&#151;but you also talk about the tragedies, such as the 
              losing seasons 1983-1985, and Blenda Gay's shocking murder. What 
              are your favorite moments from watching the Eagles antics on the 
              field and off?</em> <br>
              <strong> A:</strong> My favorite moment as a reporter was standing 
              in the end zone at Giants Stadium and watching Herman Edwards run 
              directly toward me on the Miracle of the Meadowlands. I can still 
              recall a New York cop standing next to me saying, "That CAN'T be 
              a touchdown. There has to be a penalty&#151;or something." I'll 
              never forget the silence that fell over that stadium. My other favorite 
              moment was the 1980-81 NFC Championship Game against Dallas. To 
              see the team under Dick Vermeil complete its five-year climb to 
              the top&#151;and see the celebration in the city of Philadelphia&#151;was 
              something I'll never forget. My favorite moments off the field were 
              the times I spent with the late Reggie White, watching him bring 
              hope and meaning to the lives of the people in North Philadelphia. 
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Where did you find all of the great player 
              photographs and images of the fans? How long did it take you to 
              compile the book?</em> <br>
              <strong> A:</strong> Some of the illustrations were personal photos 
              I collected over the years, growing up in Philadelphia as an Eagles 
              fan. Many of the other photos were provided by Ed Mahan, the Eagles' 
              long-time photographer, and Joe Labolito, the Temple staff photographer 
              who also shoots Eagles home games. 
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>You couldn't know all of the history and 
              trivia about the Eagles when you sat down to write the </em>Encyclopedia<em>. 
              What did you learn writing the book?</em> <br>
              <strong> A:</strong> I developed a greater appreciation for Tommy 
              Thompson, the quarterback of the Eagles' 1948-49 championship teams. 
              Previously, I thought those teams were carried by Van Buren, Pihos, 
              Alex Wojciechowicz and Bednarik, the Hall of Famers. And those players 
              were a big part of the Eagles' success. But Thompson also played 
              brilliantly. He threw 57 touchdown passes in 36 regular season games 
              in 1947-49 and his statistics compared favorably with the superstar 
              quarterbacks of that era, such as Sammy Baugh and Sid Luckman. He 
              was not given enough credit for the team's success. 
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>OK, I have to ask: Do you think the Eagles 
              will WIN the Super Bowl this year?</em> <br>
              <strong> A:</strong> I feel the Eagles still are the best team in 
              the NFC, so on that basis, I will pick them to go back to the Super 
              Bowl. Will they win it? Check back with me in February. </td>
