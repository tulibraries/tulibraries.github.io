          <td colspan="2"><p><em>In </em>Jobs Aren't Enough<em>, authors Roberta 
              Rehner Iversen and Annie Laurie Armstrong followed 25 families for 
              five years&#8212;through the economic boom of the late 1990s and 
              the bust of the early years of the 21st century&#8212;to learn about 
              low-income families who were trying to &quot;get ahead&quot; through 
              work. </em>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Can you describe your methodology?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> We followed the families in five cities&#8212;Philadelphia, 
              St. Louis, Seattle, Milwaukee, and New Orleans. We sat in on the 
              families' job training classes and day and overnight shifts at work. 
              We spent time in their children's preschools and daycare centers. 
              We also talked to at least 1,000 other people involved in these 
              families' efforts to move ahead, such as school principals, pastors, 
              and teachers. </p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>And what were your results?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> We concluded that this country needs a completely 
              new way of thinking about how families move ahead financially. We 
              need a new national policy that will ensure greater economic mobility. 
              Our book questions myths and assumptions about economic mobility&#8212;e.g., 
              &quot;Pull Yourself Up by Your Bootstraps&quot;&#8212;that actually 
              prevent low-income families from getting ahead. </p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Hence your book's title&#8212;&quot;</em>Jobs 
              Aren't Enough<em>&quot;?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> Jobs are the expected way for families to get 
              ahead financially. However, more and more two-parent, working families 
              are poor, despite hard work and initiative. In reality, their struggles 
              are due to factors beyond their control. We've seen seismic shifts 
              in the socio-economic landscape over the past several decades. There 
              have been huge changes in labor markets and companies. There have 
              been enormous shifts in welfare policy with the focus now on quick 
              employment instead of skills training. On top of that, many people 
              face inadequate housing, poorly-funded schools, inadequate wages, 
              or racial discrimination. </p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Can you discuss some of the myths you demystify 
              in your book?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> &quot;Initiative Gets You in the Door.&quot; 
              This old saw assumes that education and work are available to everyone, 
              but that [job seekers] only have to seize the opportunity. In reality, 
              the education of entry-level workers doesn't match the needs of 
              companies in the 21st century. &quot;Hard Work Pays Off &quot; assumes 
              that firms have career ladders that enable workers to move up in 
              responsibility and income. But that's not how most companies operate. 
              Instead, globalization, downsizing, outsourcing, and flexible management 
              decrease job security. And the expression &quot;Pull Yourself Up 
              By Your Bootstraps&quot; overlooks nepotism and social contacts 
              in business. Today's entry-level workers don't have these social 
              resources. They might be young dropouts or parents or immigrants. 
            </p>
            <p>The families in our book showed grit, self-reliance, and perseverance. 
              But their Horatio Alger-like big chance never came. That Alger message 
              is too simplistic for today's complex world. </p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Can you describe some characteristics of 
              the families you followed?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> In many ways, they are like millions of other 
              American families. They want what almost all parents want&#8212;a 
              good job, to earn enough to support a family, health insurance and 
              other benefits, decent and safe housing, good schools for their 
              children, enough food, assets and savings, and a little money leftover 
              to enrich their children's lives. But these families also are very 
              different from many other American families. In the richest large 
              country in the world, they work full-time, year-round, but they 
              still do not earn enough to support their families. </p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>What sort of jobs do they have?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> More than half are in manufacturing, and another 
              44 percent are in the service sector. Over the course of our study, 
              those numbers shifted with more people working in the service sector 
              and fewer in manufacturing, which mirrors the national trend. </p>
            <p>After five or more years of work, most of the parents have remained 
              in or just above entry-level jobs with limited health insurance 
              or training, and troubling safety practices. </p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>What recommendations do you make in your 
              book that can help these people?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> We say that jobs are important, but <em>jobs 
              aren't enough</em>. Instead, there are four important social institutions 
              in families' lives: first are workforce development programs, which 
              encompass colleges, community colleges and a host of programs that 
              train people; second are the firms for which people work; third 
              are their children's schools; and last, public policies. These institutions 
              play a big role in economic mobility, but instead of being interconnected, 
              they operate separately. We need to build ties between these institutions 
              that will benefit workers, firms, and communities. </p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>So, ultimately, what do you recommend to 
              start solving this problem? </em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> We need a new way of thinking about economic 
              mobility. We need to find ways to even out the wage differentials 
              in firms and resolve wage inequities. We need local, outside entities 
              to bring together colleges and training institutions, policymakers, 
              children's schools, individual job seekers, firms, and families. 
              We need better strategies for retention and advancement, including 
              financial literacy programs and tax credits. Families also need 
              more support for health care, mental health, housing, childcare, 
              children's education, and transportation. <br>
