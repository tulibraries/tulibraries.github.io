            <p><strong>Book of the Day</strong>

          <td colspan="2" valign="top"> <p>In the early seventies, in my freshman 
                year of college, one of the books we were required to purchase&#8212;for 
                what course, I forget now&#8212;was <em>Black Women in White America: 
                A Documentary History</em>, edited by Gerda Lerner. At the time, 
                Dr. Lerner, credited with teaching the first post-war college 
                course in women's history, was director of the graduate program 
                in women's history at Sarah Lawrence College. 
              <p>I remember being impressed by this 150-year anthology of rare 
                letters, journal entries, articles and speeches by black women 
                about themselves, and grateful that someone spent the time sourcing 
                and compiling this material. Indeed, I have used the book, for 
                both research and inspiration, to this day.</p>
              <p>So when I learned that Dr. Lerner, now in her early eighties, 
                had written an autobiography, <em>Fireweed: A Political Autobiography</em> 
                (Temple Univ. Press, $34.50), I wanted to speak with her about 
                it. In a starred review, PW Forecasts explained the meaning of 
                title: &quot;The hot-pink blossoms of the fireweed, which can 
                only bloom on burnt-over ground, provide an apt metaphor for this 
                memoir, one certain to find a deserved place in every collection 
                of indispensable works of women's history.&quot;</p>
              <p>Dr. Lerner spoke with me by telephone from Wisconsin, where she 
                is the Robinson-Edwards Professor of History, Emerita, at the 
                University of Wisconsin-Madison. Last month, she became the first 
                female recipient of the 2002 Bruce Catton Prize of the Society 
                of American Historians, awarded for Lifetime Achievement in Historical 
                Writing. In April she made a cameo appearance&#8212;as herself&#8212;signing 
                copies of Fireweed on the ABC-TV prime time show, Once and Again.</p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Why did you decide to write this book?</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> I felt that people know me for my work in 
                history, but they don't really know about how I got to be the 
                person I am. I'm not just a historian&#8212;I'm a survivor of 
                the Holocaust and I've lived through some different times in history. 
                I felt I should talk about that. I have had a lot of honors and 
                acclaim&#8212;but I feel that what made me a pioneer is my earlier 
                life. And I felt that my life experience has a lot of relationship 
                to today. I wanted to tell about a long-range commitment to social 
                change and making an imprint in your time.</p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>You chose to write only a partial autobiography, 
                which ends in 1958. Did you deliberately set that parameter or 
                did the biography evolve that way?</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> From the outset, I only wanted to write about 
                my life before I became an academic. Because I have a long vita 
                as an academic&#8212;it's an open book&#8212;a lot of people know 
                me for that and not anything else.</p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>You grew up a white girl in Vienna in 
                the 1920s; I grew up a black girl in the south Bronx in the 1960s. 
                Yet, reading your childhood observations, secret thoughts, resentments 
                and indignations, I identified deeply with them. Is that what 
                women's history is all about?</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> It's certainly one of the things. There are 
                things that are universal to all women. Certainly the experience 
                of being a very observant and a very active girl and being told 
                that's something you are not supposed to be&#8212;that's discrimination. 
                That happens all over the world. The experience I had of being 
                a person of privilege then being redefined by other people&#8212;one 
                minute I was a person of privilege then the next [I was not]&#8212;that 
                taught me about redefinition. My book Black Women in White America 
                came from that: I [was writing about] two women abolitionists, 
                and in the course of my research I found primary materials. Yet, 
                according to history, black women didn't exist at all.</p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>You resolved, as a young girl, to stop 
                believing what adults told you. Do you see a parallel between 
                that resolution and your interest in women's history?</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> Yes. I think that the fact that I'd been 
                a political resister from childhood on made it possible for me 
                to resist whatever the common doctrine was. [According to history,] 
                I was told there were no women. But I had lived 42 years to witness 
                that that was so wrong.</p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Why do you think that the discipline 
                of women's history did not exist as a field of study when you 
                began your career?</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> Because men wrote history and they considered 
                only what men did.</p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>What place do you think Fireweed will 
                have in the works on women's history?</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> I've had letters from people who use the 
                word &quot;inspirational.&quot; This book has a very wide appeal, 
                not just to people interested in women's history but also those 
                interested in African-American history and Jewish history. I think 
                it's quite unique in women's history. I've had quite an unusual 
                life. There are very few women in the women's history profession 
                who went from activism to academia. I think that's why people 
                write autobiographies: others learn lessons from your life.</td>
