              the three conductors who are profiled in her new book</strong></td>

		<tr>
          <td colspan="2"><p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>What do you remember about 
              your first experiences seeing the Philadelphia Orchestra perform? 
              </em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> My first experience with the Philadelphia Orchestra 
              was in Ann Arbor during the spring Festival, which Ormandy conducted 
              every year. We lived in Ann Arbor for four years, and so we became 
              &quot;aficionados&quot; of the Orchestra. When we moved to Philadelphia, 
              we were right at home with &quot;our&quot; Orchestra.
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Do you have a favorite performer, instrument, 
              composer and/or piece of music?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> One of my great memories, probably from the 
              late 60s, was a Beethoven concerto that Alicia de Larrocha played 
              with the Orchestra. She was so pleased with the performance that 
              she jumped up from the piano, ran to Ormandy, and threw her arms 
              around him. This appreciation was very typical of all soloists who 
              played with Ormandy. Over all, my favorite composer is Antonin Dvor&aacute;k, 
              with Tchaikovsky and Richard Strauss as close seconds. I have several 
              favorite compositions from a variety of composers. Since the violin 
              is my favorite instrument, I love most violin concertos and violin 
              music.</p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Concerning the &quot;Philadelphia Sound,&quot; 
              you write in your Preface: &quot;The seeds were sown by Stokowski, 
              flowered with Ormandy, were strictly cultivated by Muti, and flowered 
              again, but with more definition, under Sawallisch.&quot; What do 
              you think accounts for the different styles of each conductor?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> I think the differences come from both the intent 
              and the personality of the conductor. Ormandy concentrated on beautiful 
              sound above all else; Muti wanted precision and balance and a different 
              style for each composer; Sawallisch, in a certain way, combined 
              the approaches.</p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Do you have a favorite conductor?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> I do, but I took great pains to be nonpartisan 
              in my writing. It pleased me when three musicians read the first 
              draft and each chose a different conductor as my favorite. Readers 
              can make their own decisions about my preference.</p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Is there a particular composer or piece 
              of music you associate with each of the conductors, and can you 
              recall seeing a particularly inspired performance by each conductor?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> I associate Rachminoff's music with Ormandy. 
              They were good friends and often worked together. With Muti I associate 
              the concert operas that he conducted with the Orchestra. With Sawallisch 
              it is the music of Strauss and Brahms, plus the German repertoire 
              in general. There are so many inspired performances that it would 
              be difficult to list them.</p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>The relationship of the Orchestra members 
              and the Orchestra's board with each conductor is very important 
              and </em>Philadelphia Maestros<em> addresses both of these concerns 
              in its pages. How do you feel that these relationships have shifted 
              over time?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> Rather than &quot;shifted&quot; I would say 
              that the relationship between Music Director and the board has an 
              alternating pattern. Stokowski's relationship was turbulent, and 
              he proffered his resignation several times. Ormandy and the Orchestra 
              Board had good relations as evidenced by his 44 years as Music Director. 
              Muti announced soon into his directorship that &quot;the board worked 
              for the Orchestra, not the other way around.&quot; Relations between 
              Sawallisch and the board were again calm.</p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>You were able to interview Lang Lang, Sarah 
              Chang, and Gary Graffman about their relationship with the conductors. 
              Why did you choose these three performers, and did anything they 
              say surprise you?</em> <br>
              <strong>A:</strong> I chose these three because of their links to 
              the Philadelphia scene. Gary Graffman began studying at Curtis when 
              he was 7, and was the soloist many times with Ormandy. Lang Lang 
              came to Curtis at age 14, studied under Mr. Graffman, and made his 
              debut with the Orchestra under Sawallisch. Sarah Chang was born 
              in Philadelphia and made her debut with the Orchestra under Muti. 
              I was surprised at the warmth and admiration that each expressed 
              for the conductors.</p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>The book has some beautiful photos of a 
              young Ormandy at the violin, Muti passionately conducting, and Swallisch 
              at rehearsal. What can you say about the photos used in the book?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> The University of Pennsylvania Rare Book and 
              Manuscript Library has an extensive collection of Ormandy's photos. 
              I am told that the one of Ormandy and Stokowski is very rare&#8212;it's 
              the only photo of both conductors posed together. Since the Archives 
              of the Orchestra have been closed, it was possible to obtain only 
              one of Muti from this rich source. Fortunately <em>The Philadelphia 
              Inquirer</em> made possible those of Sawallisch, all from his later 
              years.</p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>What kind of research did you do to write 
              this book? And what made you focus on just these three conductors?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> I have always been fascinated by the role of 
              the conductor&#8212;particularly the three in my book&#8212;because 
              I have watched them consistently over the years. I began by reading 
              every thing I could find about each conductor. Then I went to the 
              Archives of the Orchestra (then open), and those of the Music Division 
              of the Free Library. The University of Pennsylvania Libraries has 
              voluminous material on Ormandy. From there, I began my interviews 
              with members of the Orchestra.</p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Why did you decide to write this particular 
              book&#8212;a homage to the three conductors and the Orchestra&#8212;instead 
              of continuing your previous scholarly work?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> Throughout my professional career I wrote two 
              books and many articles and essays in the field of Spanish and Latin 
              American literature. After I retired from Temple University, I had 
              the desire to write something different, and so I turned to my other 
              great love&#8212;classical music. It was a joy to write this book, 
              especially because the many musicians that I interviewed were so 
              enthusiastic and so generous with their time. This opened up different 
              perspectives and a new focus to my writing.</p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Do you play a musical instrument? Did you 
              ever dream of being a member of the Philadelphia Orchestra?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> I played the piano until my daughter was in 
              3rd grade&#8212;by then she could play my entire repertoire much 
              better than I. Vicariously I have shared her musical education at 
              Juilliard and her subsequent career as a pianist. I did minor in 
              music as an undergraduate, but I never imagined myself anywhere 
              but in the audience listening to the Orchestra.<br>
