              IN BENGALI-AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS. </strong><br>
              By Sandip Roy for <em><a href="http://www.telegraphindia.com/1050315/asp/atleisure/story_4491541.asp">The 
              Telegraph</a></em>, Calcutta</td>

		<tr>
          <td colspan="2"><p>What makes a Bengali Bengali? The answer always seems 
              to lie in fish. As an atypical Bengali who spent his whole life 
              trying to avoid fish, I always felt I was just not Bengali enough 
              because I didn't salivate at the prospect of koi-maach. Moving to 
              America, I thought I had escaped the accusing stare of the beady-eyed 
              rui. And then I find myself in an Asian fishmarket in San Francisco 
              staring nostalgically at piles of silvery fish. "We grew up in communities 
              of taste," says Prof. Krishnendu Ray. "It is subconsciously embedded.&quot; 
              In the act of migration, that community of taste is suddenly lost. 
            <p>Prof. Ray should know. After coming to the US to study political 
              economy of development and underdevelopment, he was, as he puts 
              it, "waylaid by that disreputable phenomenon &#8212; nostalgia or 
              the idealising of home-cooked food". What started as his personal 
              journey to deal with the loss of shukto and ilish on a monsoon afternoon, 
              has now become the first actual study of meals and memories in Bengali-American 
              households &#8212; <em>The Migrant's Table</em>.</p>
            <p>Prof. Ray sent out a survey to some 1,000 Bengali families asking 
              questions like "What was yesterday's lunch in your home?&quot; and 
              "What is your weekly fish bill?&quot; The answers, he hoped, would 
              tell him not just what to expect for dinner on an average night 
              at the Banerjee household in New Jersey but some larger issues of 
              immigration and assimilation.</p>
            <p>He found that Bengali-Americans spent on an average $91 a week 
              at the grocery store and another $14 at a specialty Asian market. 
              Dinner remained aggressively Bengali. Lunch was a mixed bag. Breakfast 
              was toast and cereal. Single men reluctantly learn American eating 
              habits like cold cuts and cold cereals but reassert their Bengaliness 
              after marriage. Women are willing to play a little more with American 
              food &#8212; think turkey samosa. Women still do the bulk of the 
              cooking, though 65 per cent have professional credentials or a master's 
              degree. But almost half hold "jobs&quot; rather than pursue "careers". 
              Only 10 per cent of married men do grocery shopping on their own.</p>
            <p>The act of migration also suddenly opens up a supermarket of possibilities. 
              Families who ate chicken once a week can now eat it everyday. Take 
              fish. A USAID survey in 1972 found 41 per cent of upper middle-class 
              households in Calcutta ate fish for lunch on a typical weekday. 
              At dinner in Bengali-American households, that rises to 63 per cent. 
              Sixty-six per cent have meat.</p>
            <p>But the plenty doesn't mean it's the same. Fish is abundant in 
              America but Bengalis like whole freshwater fish. Fish fillets and 
              steaks are just not gada and peti. "It doesn't taste the same," 
              says Ray. "But what people are really missing are other memories.&quot; 
              Sure, potol and mocha might be hard to find but sometimes more than 
              the food, it's the associations.</p>
            <p>"Saraswati Puja will not be the same without khichuri or sandesh 
              shaped like lotus or fish," says Bharti Kirchner, the author of 
              <em>The Healthy Cuisine of India: Recipes from the Bengal Region</em>. 
              The problem for Bengalis is Bengali food is not even available in 
              Indian restaurants. "Regional cooking was preserved at homes while 
              restaurants in India made Mughlai cooking the standard," says Kirchner. 
              Even at a Bengali conference in Atlantic City in 2000, there were 
              six food vendors &#8212; three served pizza, sandwiches and pretzels, 
              the other three served south Indian, north Indian and bhelpuri. 
              No alur dom, no luchis, forget doi-potol.</p>
            <p>At one level, being hard-to-find gives food its value, says Ray 
              "because food is the mythologisation of the mundane". 
              That's why immigrants wax eloquent about street food like 
              puchka or jhal muri which they endlessly try to replicate. "But 
              the damn things never taste like the jhal muri I had on the train," chuckles Ray.</p>
            <p>Nirmalya Modak helped start the first Bengali restaurant, Charulata, 
              in the San Francisco Bay Area. While Charulata served lau-chingri 
              and shorshe-ilish, the occasional customer would still ask for naan. 
              "During Durga Puja it was very crowded," remembers Modak. 
              "People would say, let's get luchi and kasha meat curry 
              at Charulata. It will be just like the Pujas in Calcutta.&#8221; 
              But eventually, Charulata closed down, unable to rely on Bengali 
              nostalgia as a viable business model. There are only some 30,000 
              Bengalis in the US. And if you include Bangla- deshis, the numbers 
              hover around 100,000 says Ray.</p>
            <p>Because you can only really get it at home, because it is an ethnic 
              secret not easily available commercially, Bengali food becomes the 
              place where the angst of immigration really stews. "Fathers 
              anguish that if their children don't like shukto they will 
              never grow up Bengali," says Ray. Of course, he chuckles, 
              back in Calcutta, the same fathers might have been longing for kebabs 
              at Nizam's or cakes from New Market instead of shukto and 
              daal-bhaat at home.</p>
            <p>At some level, assimilation is inevitable. Even when the children 
              identify with their culture, it's probably more as Indian 
              as opposed to Bengali. "So they will eat samosas rather than 
              phulkopir singhara," says Ray. He realises it most acutely 
              when he brings his own four-year-old son to India. His typical menu 
              &#8212; macaroni and cheese with his daal bhaat. His comfort food 
              is now truly Bengali-American.</p></td>
