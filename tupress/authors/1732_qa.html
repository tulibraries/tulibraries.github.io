            <p><strong>Michael Mello debates Legalizing Gay Marriage </strong>
            <p><strong>A Q&A with the Temple University Press author examines 
              the issues at the heart of this hot topic </strong></td>
        </tr>
		<tr>
          <td colspan="2"><p><strong>Q:</strong> Legalizing Gay Marriage<em> is 
              unlike other &quot;gay marriage&quot; books in that it focuses mainly 
              on the civil union decision in Vermont. Your book also includes 
              information on the Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts. Why 
              did you focus on these particular aspects of the issue? </em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> Vermont and Massachusetts define the range of 
              options: a marriage-lite system, versus full-fledged marriage. And 
              Vermont was the first battleground, while Massachusetts is the present 
              battleground. 
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>You describe civil unions as a </em>compromise<em>, 
              suggesting that civil unions were created to please everyone on 
              both sides of the issue and yet, they ended up pleasing no one. 
              Can you elaborate on why this was the case?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> The rancor of the battles left a bad taste in 
              everyone's mouth. Gays and Lesbians wanted real victory while marriage 
              homophobes wanted nothing. What is more, most Vermonters didn't 
              want to think about the issue at all. </p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>You describe many cases of gay or lesbian 
              couples wanting to get married. Which one do you think is the most 
              interesting, or significant in this huge debate?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> Nina Beck's story&#8212;she was one of the six 
              people in the <em>Baker vs. State</em> case. Ms. Beck and her partner 
              Stacy Jolles were together for almost a decade. When Ms. Beck was 
              pregnant, and complications developed that resulted in her son Noah 
              being born with a heart defect, Ms. Jolles was denied entry into 
              the emergency room to be with her partner and their child. </p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>What is fascinating in </em>Legalizing 
              Gay Marriage<em> are the letters to the newspaper editors volleying 
              the issue back and forth. From the impassioned letter by Sharon 
              Underwood, the mother of a gay son, to the opposition's campaign 
              to &quot;Take Back Vermont,&quot; the impact of these two warring 
              groups was incredible. Can you discuss this &quot;war that happened 
              on the ground?&quot;</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> &quot;Take Back Vermont&quot; was an organized 
              political campaign to defeat civil unions in the legislatures. The 
              letters were the grassroots manipulation of Take Back Vermont's 
              efforts. While some letters supported civil unions, the bitterness 
              of the opponents' letters was stunning. The net effect was an atmosphere 
              of hate in which gay couples I know felt threatened, isolated, and 
              despised. </p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>You say that the public backlash to </em>Baker 
              vs. State<em> forced you to think more deeply about the issues, 
              and that without this you would not have written this book. Why 
              were you so drawn to this cause? </em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> The battle was exploding all around me. It was 
              a battle about law and I'm a schoolteacher. But what got me into 
              the conflict wasn't abstract. This controversy was about real people, 
              real people I know and care about&#8212;friends, students, neighbors, 
              faculty, colleagues. That, by the way, was how I got sucked into 
              capital punishment issue 22 years ago. It's the people, not the 
              cause.</p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>There are all kinds of permutations with 
              family these days. Queer parents, and cases of unmarried straight 
              couples having children. A 50% divorce rate for heterosexual couples, 
              and the first same-sex divorce case. Do you feel that the sanctity 
              of marriage has benefited from the </em>Baker vs. State<em> decision?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> Heterosexual marriage is no weaker in Vermont 
              or in Massachusetts because its not a zero sum game&#8212;my marriage 
              loses nothing by admitting gay couples. Heterosexuals take marriage 
              for granted; it's good for us to see gay couples fight for admission, 
              because it reminds us how important this right of marriage really 
              is. Every election year, I remind my students about those who died 
              in the 1960's to secure the vote for African Americans.</td>
