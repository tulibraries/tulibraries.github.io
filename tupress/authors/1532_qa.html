          <td colspan="2" valign="top"> <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>You say in 
                the beginning of your remarkable memoir </em>White Boy<em> that 
                your heroes were often black. You saw them on television and heard 
                them on the radio &quot;without seeing their blackness as socially 
                significant.&quot; What made these particular athletes and performers 
                special to you?</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> They did what they did brilliantly and with 
                style and we wanted to imitate them&#8212;whether it was Willie 
                Mays making a catch, or Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers singing 
                harmony. And that made us the first generation of whites to openly 
                look to black people for inspiration. 
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>You describe in your chapter &quot;Race 
                Conscious&quot; the &quot;threat&quot; blacks posed&#8212;both 
                real and imagined&#8212;in your community and even in your school. 
                You were transferred (by your parents) to another high school after an &quot;incident&quot; 
                occurred in your high school locker room. How did these events 
                affect you?</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> Being beaten up, or getting in fights, was 
                no big deal to me&#8212;it had happened plenty of times with white 
                kids. So my parents' decision to move me to another school seemed 
                irrational. My parents' racial outbursts&#8212;and their response 
                to black people generally&#8212;deeply offended me.</p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>You entered Columbia University with 
                the excitement and naivete of any Freshman. Yet your impressions 
                changed once you got there. Can you describe that?</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> It was an intimidating place for a kid from 
                the streets of Brooklyn, but there were some brilliant professors 
                and interesting students and I gradually gained confidence socially 
                and academically.</p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>It was through friends of the Columbia 
                basketball team that you met Ruthie, your black girlfriend. You 
                spent six years with her, and your romance had serious repercussions 
                for both of you and your respective families. You claim you were 
                &quot;not an activist trying to defy tradition&quot; by having 
                this relationship. What can you say about this relationship?</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> It began with curiosity, attraction, and excitement, 
                and then a grim determination not to let prejudice drive us apart. 
                Ruthie shared these feelings, but she faced a lot of disapproval 
                from nationalist black students in the late '60s . Sometimes she 
                felt it was &quot;too much pressure.&quot; My parents were violently 
                opposed to the relationship and continued to pretend that &quot;Ruthie 
                was not a part of my life&quot; </p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>How did the Black Power Movement's directive 
                that blacks &quot;take control of their organizations&quot; put 
                a strain on interracial friendships and organizations?</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> Many black intellectuals and activists came 
                to feel that the presence of whites in the black community retarded 
                the development of black leadership. They began to re-evaluate 
                personal and political relationships with white friends and co-workers.</p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Do you care to comment about being arrested?</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> In the era of civil rights and the Vietnam 
                War, being arrested for one's political principles was a mark 
                of commitment. Getting arrested to protest Columbia's attempt 
                to build a gym in a Harlem park was something I was proud of at 
                the time&#8212;and am still proud of now.</p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>So you have no regrets?</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> None at all, I've had a great life!
              <p> <strong>Q:</strong> <em>Would you have done anything different?</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> If I were a little smarter, I would have left 
                the Weatherman organization the minute I heard them talking about 
                &quot;smashing monogamy&quot; instead of waiting until I had gotten 
                arrested with them in a stupid incident in a Brooklyn coffee shop.</p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>How did you feel when you first began 
                teaching a Black History course? Wasn't that a risky undertaking 
                for a white man in 1968?</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> I felt nervous, but not frightened. I knew 
                most of the students I was teaching as a counselor and a coach. 
                But I made sure that their voices were equal to mine by organizing 
                the class around a debate format.</p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>How satisfying was it for your &quot;life's 
                work&quot; to culminate in being accepted as an instructor in 
                the Black Studies Department at Fordham?</em> <br>
                <strong>A:</strong> It was extremely satisfying, but it was only 
                possible because my black colleagues believed that Black Studies 
                was for everyone in the university. Some black students rejected 
                my presence, but my large enrollments, the support of my colleagues, 
                and the friendships I made on the basketball court helped neutralize 
                their opposition. Eventually, I became more comfortable in my 
                job than anything I had ever done.</p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Do you care to comment on the Leonard 
                Jeffries flap?</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> I defended&#8212;and would still defend&#8212;his 
                right to teach, but deeply resented the fact that many whites 
                I met thought his theories and conduct were representative of 
                Black Studies. </p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>What did you get out of revisiting all 
                of these heady times from your life?</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> The best part of it was seeing how excited 
                my students and my children have been about the book. They have 
                been <em>White Boy</em>'s biggest supporters. They completely 
                identify with a tale about crossing racial boundaries. They have 
                shown their support by designing and wearing &quot;<em>White Boy</em> 
                tee shirts,&quot; helping me develop a website and trying to set 
                up signings, book parties and media appearances. <br>
