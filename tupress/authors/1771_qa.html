              The Paradox of the Jobless Recovery</a><br>
              Stanley Aronowitz</p>
            <p><strong>A Q&A with author Stanley Aronowitz about his searing indictment 
              of the American way of recession and recovery, <em>Just Around the 
              Corner: The Paradox of the Jobless Recovery</em> </strong></td>

		<tr>
          <td colspan="2"><p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Your main argument in this 
              book is that it is a fallacy to believe that if the economy is good 
              then we have jobs and growth. How did you come to this conclusion, 
              and what made you realize that this is the case?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> I observed this disconnect in the early 1990s 
              in connection with a book I co-authored called <em>The Jobless Future</em>. 
              The &quot;recovery&quot; of 1992-3 produced a lot of &quot;McJobs&quot; 
              but continued to hemorrhage good jobs&#8212;those paying a living 
              wage, providing benefits, and presuming permanent status to the 
              employee. This trend continued throughout the 1990s but became prevalent 
              during the first four years of the 21st century.
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>You suggest that the Clinton Boom years 
              and the Bush recession are two sides of the same coin, with chronic 
              unemployment (and underemployment) present in both periods. How 
              do you feel each President handled their respective situations? 
              </em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> Badly. Clinton signed the Welfare Reform Act 
              in 1996 amidst the dot.com boom and retired from office before the 
              bust of 2001-3. Neither president took extraordinary measures to 
              combat structural unemployment. In Bush's case we have had a pandemic 
              of structural unemployment and underemployment and the administration 
              believes tax cuts are the answer. Both, however were tied to a crude 
              and rather unrealistic concept of jobs and believed that economic 
              growth automatically leads to job growth.</p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>You talk in your preface about how technology 
              </em>at first<em> produced more jobs, but in the long run it destroyed 
              more jobs than it created. What trends are you seeing in the job 
              market now?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> The idea that economy recovery can be measured 
              by growth data and that, therefore, good jobs follow economic growth, 
              is a kind of mantra based on the previous industrializing era and 
              the effect of large numbers of private and public sector service 
              jobs existing to take up the slack produced by shrinking manufacturing 
              jobs. In recent years many private sector jobs are temporary, contingent 
              and low paid; public sector employment has largely stagnated except 
              in education and health.</p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Can you explain why you chose the title 
              &quot;Just around the Corner&quot;? You use this phrase in your 
              chapter on &quot;The Reagan Revolution.&quot; Can you discuss the 
              effects Reagan's policies had on the job market? </em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> &quot;Just around the Corner&quot; is an ironic 
              comment. I believe we are racing to the bottom as fast as workers 
              will let employers get away with bad jobs. However, 2% of the population 
              is doing very well, another 8% is treading water and 90% have experienced 
              decline of real wages in the past twenty years. That's the legacy 
              of the Reagan Revolution.</p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>You open Chapter 3 with a discussion of 
              the &quot;economic malaise&quot; generated by outsourcing and trade 
              deficits. What do you think are the solutions to these by-products 
              of globalization? </em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> Some outsourcing is inevitable and may be necessary 
              for some businesses. But outsourcing to reduce labor costs is unacceptable 
              and should be regulated by law and by labor agreements. Cost containment 
              is the enemy of balanced trade. Trade deficits are a direct consequence 
              of deindustrialization. Many things that were once produced in the 
              USA are no longer made here: clothing, textiles, and some of our 
              steel. 25% of autos sold in this country are made abroad, and recently 
              even engineering and computer products which many economists believed 
              would replace &quot;rust belt&quot; products, are made elsewhere&#8212;especially 
              in China, Japan and India. </p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>You suggest that Americans have lost their 
              collective voice. What do you recommend people do to stop job destruction 
              and outsourcing?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> Restrain employers from outsourcing in order 
              to save labor costs, by law; fight to raise wages and living standards 
              in developing countries by supporting workers who want to organize 
              free trade unions; and workers should consider operating abandoned 
              plants that once produced now imported products by forming cooperatives.</p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> Just Around the Corner<em> also addresses issues 
              of health care, the privatization of Social Security, and other 
              timely topics. You advocate unionization as being the best support 
              for workers rights, especially in an era with so much job insecurity. 
              Given the struggles to unionize in the past few decades, why do 
              you feel this is still true?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> If unions are now weak, in part, because of 
              globalization, it does not mean they are outmoded. Rebuilding the 
              labor movement is one of the best measures to revive jobs because 
              Organized Labor, with all of its problems, remains the best defender 
              of workers interests.</p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>You conclude with the idea that we are 
              working harder and longer for less money and that minimum wage is 
              one third of the average wage. Do you feel that things will ever 
              improve?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> Things will improve when the American people 
              lift the scales from their eyes and refuse to be tricked, bamboozled, 
              and scared. Intentional or not, the War on Terror has set America 
              back a half century. Even during the Vietnam War, when the threat 
              of terrorism was announced by the Johnson administration, the federal 
              government was forced by Labor and the Civil Rights Movement to 
              recognize structural unemployment as a serious American problem. 
              Today this question has been buried in war fever. When we take the 
              antibiotic of common sense, we can change the world.</td>
