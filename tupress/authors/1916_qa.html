		<tr>
          <td colspan="2" valign="top"> <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Congratulations on your book. Why did 
		  you wait almost 40 years to tell your story?</em> <br>
			<strong>A:</strong> My life wasn�t ready to be told in story until there was a closure with my athletic, 
			teaching, and coaching career. The time I needed to devote to such an adventure was too 
			great. You have to begin somewhere to be great. The race began in 1968 and now it is 
			time to tell the journey of &quot;how did I get to this race, and where did I go when it was 
			over?&quot;<br>
			<br>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>You say you &quot;never regretted&quot; your actions 
			on the victory stand, &quot;and never will&quot;�that it was, as you write�&quot;something 
			I felt I had no choice in doing.&quot; Did you think at the time that your 
			protest would become one of the most famous protests in sports history?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> I do not feel remorseful about the act on the 
			  victory stand as it was an act of &quot;faith.&quot; Because I believe in &quot;hope&quot; 
			  for our changing society, the evidence of non-equality had to be 
			  challenged. At the time, my &quot;visual&quot; on the victory stand was not 
			  thought of as a portrait to be classified as a picture of history, 
			  but as a cry for freedom. <br>
              <br>
              <strong>Q:</strong> <em>Do you think that such a protest could take place now? </em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> Making the same gesture now is defeat; let us repeat the 
			  cry with sounds of understanding and deliverance. </p>
			  
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Can you briefly describe the </em>Olympic Project 
			for Human Rights<em> and discuss your participation in it?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> <em>The Olympic Project for Human Rights</em> was a 
			  non-violent platform used in the athletic arena as a cry for freedom. 
			  It originated on the <em>San Jose State University</em> campus in 1967. I was 
			  one athlete who chose to involve myself for the human rights issues. </p>
			  
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>You and your family received death threats and 
			hate mail before and after Mexico City. Were you prepared for this? How did 
			you handle living in fear? </em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> My family received hate mail and death threats 
			  which altered our daily routine, but we had to continue to remain calm 
			  and socially aware. There are still some [people] who do not change and 
			  there are some who have made progress. </p>
			  
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>You have been &quot;forever linked&quot; with John Carlos 
			(Bronze medal winner at the 1968 Mexico City games) on and off since the Olympics. 
			How has your relationship with him been over the years since your &quot;silent gesture&quot;? </em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> I had not known John Carlos until my senior year in college, in 1967. 
			  Since then, my response to John has been a respectful acquaintance. </p>
			  
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>You talk about how </em>San Jose State<em> welcomed you 
			back and dedicated a statue to you and John Carlos. How have attitudes 
			towards you�and your actions�changed over time?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> When I returned to the <em>San Jose State University</em>			  for the statue dedication, attitudes were fresh, warm and respectful. 
			  The student body and administration was knowledgeable and unafraid in 
			  their quest to identify pioneers from the past and ideally, former 
			  students such as John Carlos and me. <br>
              <br>
			  
              <strong>Q:</strong> <em>You have worked as a track & field coach 
			  and talk about your coaches in Silent Gesture. Do you have any particular 
			  mentors and coaches that influenced you?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> There are two coaches in my past that I will 
			  forever remember because of their knowledge and their social attitude. 
			  They were positive &quot;in the time of need.&quot; Lloyd C. &quot;Bud&quot; Winter, 
			  my college coach and Bill Walsh, my professional football area coach 
			  with the Cincinnati Bengals. </p>
			  
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> Silent Gesture <em>dispels the rumors that you 
			were a member of the Black Panthers. Your book also clears the record 
			that the </em>Mexico City Olympic Committee<em> did not take for your medals 
			back, or throw you out of the Olympic Village. Can you discuss these 
			rumors?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> Tommie Smith has never been a Black Panther. 
			  I am still in possession of my gold medal�I won the race fair and 
			  square, and so the medal is mine. I stayed in the Olympic Village 
			  until the race was over, and I returned the next day to get my belongings. 
			  As I was leaving, the press was everywhere, so kicking me out of 
			  the Olympic Village was a &quot;helpful exit.&quot; </p>
			  
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>I understand at one point in time you 
			were interested in selling your medals. Is that true? Why did you consider this? </em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> I will answer a question with a question�Can 
			  you find a Humanitarian donor for $500,000?</p>
			  
			  <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>You are a hero to many for your actions�who 
			  were your heroes?   </em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., a man who had a 
			  Dream of Freedom and Equality, and my father, Richard Smith, who 
			  taught me pain is obvious, but how you react is not.</p>
			  
			  <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>What do you think your legacy will be? </em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> I want to leave a legacy that says, &quot;Tommie Smith 
			  was a Man who also had a Dream and a Vision and his Standing was not in vain.&quot;</p>
