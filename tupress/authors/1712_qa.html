          <td colspan="2"><p>Everyone knows that doing homework is a must for 
              a good education, right? Not necessarily, according to author John 
              Buell. Revamping how much and what type of homework is assigned 
              can create more opportunities for learning. Included: Ideas for 
              changing the way homework is used in schools.
            <p>Most of us assume that homework has been a constant in K-12 life, 
              and its attributes are known and documented: homework is necessary 
              to re-enforce classroom lessons, teach responsibility, and prepare 
              students for the full-time working world.</p>
            <p>Not so, according to author John Buell in his book, <em>Closing 
              The Book on Homework: Enhancing Public Education and Freeing Family 
              Time</em>. While not advocating the elimination of homework, Buell 
              argues that the way homework is assigned and where it is done needs 
              to be changed.</p>
            <p>Nor has homework always been a fixture in U.S. schools. Starting 
              in the late 19th century, homework opponents argued that homework 
              damaged the physical, emotional, and mental health of children, 
              by reducing the amount of time they had to play and get fresh air. 
              The attitude again came to the forefront in the 1920's and 1930's, 
              at a time when labor unions were lobbying for workplace reforms. 
              Homework often was branded &quot;unhealthy&quot; for children.</p>
            <p>Research showing homework improves student performance is inconclusive, 
              Buell adds. Homework even may be counterproductive for young children 
              already tired from a six-hour day and the commute to and from school.</p>
            <p>Older students could be assigned additional work, Buell suggests, 
              which they would do after school in a room with resources and adult 
              supervision, to be fair to children who don't have study materials 
              or parents at home to help them.</p>
            <p>This is Buell's second book on homework; he also co-authored <em>The 
              End of Homework: How Homework Disrupts Families, Overburdens Children, 
              and Limits Learning</em> with Etta Kralovec.</p>
            <p>A former college professor, Buell currently is a columnist for 
              the <em>Bangor Daily News</em> in Maine, and also writes for other 
              newspapers and magazines on labor, education, and environmental 
              issues. He recently talked with <em>Education World</em> about his 
              latest book and how societal work expectations affect education.</p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>How did you become interested in the homework 
              issue?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> I taught for almost ten years at College of 
              the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, Maine. The school emphasizes interdisciplinary 
              education. My field of teaching and research was political economy, 
              but I worked extensively with a colleague who directed the teacher 
              education program.<br>
              John Buell</p>
            <p>My colleague, Etta Kralovec, was approached by the state of Maine 
              to study the causes of high dropout rates in rural communities. 
              She knew that I was interested in rural poverty issues and the relationship 
              between labor markets and schools. She asked me if I wanted to participate. 
              As part of our study, we did extensive interviews with many dropouts. 
              We asked all of them if there was a point in their education when 
              they knew they simply were not going to make it. Much to our surprise, 
              every student had a story about homework. We had not anticipated 
              this result, and this finding led both of us to do further research 
              on the history of homework and on the justifications on its behalf 
              in the literature.</p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>How did homework become so entrenched in 
              our culture and synonymous with successful schools? I've read that 
              some schools now assign students homework over the summer and grade 
              students on it.</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> Homework has not always been front and center 
              in public education. But during times of economic political or cultural 
              crisis, homework often takes center stage. We have to ask to what 
              extent homework is the best response to real educational failings, 
              to what extent it is a scapegoat for other institutional failings, 
              or even part of larger cultural wars reflected in current crises.</p>
            <p>Right now, schools are under extraordinary pressure because many 
              political and business leaders view our educational system as crucial 
              in giving student skills that will allow them to be more effective 
              participants in the job market. They view the job market as increasingly 
              internationalized and ever more competitive. Unfortunately, many 
              are unwilling or unable to examine the way business practices, international 
              organizations, and trade treaties have shaped the very terms of 
              this competition. Thus, the pressures on schools and teachers often 
              have been passed on to students and parents. Students are tested 
              more and teachers are under the gun. To meet these intensified requirements, 
              more homework often is seen as one of the key solutions.</p>
            <p>But in addition to this concern growing out of political economy, 
              one needs to put the issue in a broader cultural perspective. One 
              could say that homework is a part of larger cultural wars. In their 
              workplaces, workers are constantly encouraged to &quot;do their 
              homework&quot; and in school, children are told that homework is 
              &quot;part of their job.&quot;</p>
            <p>These cultural practices are a response to cultural anxieties. 
              Americans increasingly have a kind of love-hate relationship with 
              work. Work is viewed as one of the central meanings of life, but 
              at the same time, it now takes so much of many adults' lives that 
              there is little room for anything else. And at least on some level, 
              doubts have crept in as to the limits of work itself. I believe 
              that although the debate about homework involves genuine pedagogical 
              issues, one cannot fully understand this issue or the heat surrounding 
              it without some attention to this cultural civil war over whether 
              work is to retain its all-encompassing place in our culture.</p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>What did you mean in the book when you 
              said while students who do more homework may get better grades, 
              there is nothing to connect homework with improved student performance?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> Even homework advocates concede that many studies 
              of homework do not really resolve what we might call a chicken and 
              egg question. It may well be the case that good and well-motivated 
              students do homework, whereas less capable or informed students 
              do not do any or as much homework. Doing extensive homework may 
              be a symptom of academic accomplishment rather than a cause. To 
              use the formal language of social science, we don't always know 
              whether we are looking at mere correlation or causality. But I would 
              like to add that this rather abstract sounding debate is only a 
              small part of the story. In my book, I have discussed other considerations 
              growing out of learning theory and developmental psychology to suggest 
              that the efficacy of homework may be overrated.</p>
            <p>Even most of homework's advocates now concede that homework in 
              the elementary grades does not achieve the academic gains once promised. 
              Many have fallen back on the contention that homework at a young 
              age is primarily valuable in getting students accustomed to doing 
              more work. This claim itself is not well documented and demonstrates 
              to me some of the cultural overtones to this whole debate.</p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Without homework, how else would teachers 
              evaluate students?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> Homework only is one way that teachers evaluate 
              students. In the book, I do more than merely call for limits to 
              homework. Older students can be given other forms of independent 
              work in a context where they have the resources and support they 
              need to succeed. One of the problems with homework is that many 
              students don't have these resources and support. And with homework, 
              as I discuss at greater length in the book, because the student 
              performance can be influenced or aided by so many other outside 
              variables, there is a real problem with evaluation as it stands.</p>
            <p>More broadly, both with respect to issues of instruction and evaluation, 
              schools need to make better use of their existing time.</p>
            <p>Along the same lines, I often have been asked how parents can maintain 
              contact with the school if they are not involved in their children's 
              homework. From my perspective, homework often is a significant burden 
              for both teacher and student. Some reductions in the time spent 
              doing and grading homework would create far more opportunities for 
              direct interaction between students, parents, and teachers.</p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>What type of response are you getting from 
              teachers to your message?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> Neither teachers nor students are a monolith 
              on this subject. When we wrote our first book, several parents and 
              teachers said to me &quot;students must really love your book.&quot; 
              But in fact, students were as divided about the book as our other 
              constituencies. I think the comment about students may have reflected 
              a degree of cynicism that I do not share. With respect to teachers, 
              I am gratified that even some teachers who don't agree with the 
              theme of the book nonetheless felt that it raised important issues 
              that needed a more thorough airing.</p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Where should reform about work expectations 
              in our society start: in the workplace and then move into the schools, 
              or in the schools and then into the workplace?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> This is a good question. Too often in society, 
              we dump responsibility for reform on the schools. But if most employees 
              are working inordinately long and oppressive hours -- especially 
              in unfulfilling and not very remunerative occupations, there will 
              be immense pressure on schools to prepare workers for this grind, 
              and by implication, to legitimize it. By the same token, if schools 
              can successfully impart basic skills and the capacity for critical 
              thought within a reasonable number of hours, thereby affording more 
              opportunities for creative use of leisure time, their success in 
              this endeavor enables a different kind of workplace and a different 
              culture.</p>
            <p>Thus, I am inclined to think that reform needs to be pursued in 
              both arenas. More free time outside of schools and jobs and more 
              opportunities for creative expression within them are both possible 
              and necessary.</p>
            <p>We should keep foremost in our mind that both of these issues are 
              united by the overarching concept of time -- who controls it and 
              toward what end. I would suggest that spending long hours at home 
              doing your homework in the hope that you'll get a good job and enjoy 
              a good quality of life is the educational equivalent, to borrow 
              Robert Putnam's phrase, of bowling alone. It is unlikely to yield 
              a more skilled or more satisfied athlete. More of the time spent 
              by students and parents on homework would be better expended in 
              efforts to reform both public schools and workplaces. And success 
              in each realm aids efforts in the other.</p>
