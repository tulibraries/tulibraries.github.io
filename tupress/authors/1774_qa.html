            <p><strong>20 questions for Marc Stein </strong>

          <td colspan="2"><p><strong>Background:</strong> Marc Stein is a soft-spoken 
              30-something who carries the recent history of gay Philadelphia 
              around in his head the way the rest of us carry our personal memories. 
              His book, <em>The City of Sisterly and Brotherly Loves: The Making 
              of Lesbian and Gay Communities in Greater Philadelphia, 1945-1976</em> 
              (to be published by University of Chicago Press in 1997), focuses 
              on the relationship between lesbians and gay men in Philadelphia 
              post-World War II and pre-AIDS epidemic. The book will join a number 
              of studies that have explored gay and lesbian communities across 
              the United States.
            <p>After growing up in suburban New York, Stein became involved in 
              gay and peace activism in Boston, where he edited the Gay Community 
              News and the Arms Control Reporter and helped to found the AIDS 
              organization Act Out. In 1989 he traded in the bullhorn for the 
              word processor and became a doctoral student in history at the University 
              of Pennsylvania, where he studied Philadelphia's gay community. 
              Currently, he holds a Mellon Post-Doctoral Fellowship in gender 
              studies and history at Bryn Mawr College. Stein will be discussing 
              his research on Thursday, Oct. 26, at 7:30p.m. at Penguin Place, 
              201 S. Camac Street, in a talk titled, &quot;Perverts in the Philadelphia 
              Press, 1945-1960.&quot;</p>
            <p><strong>Q: </strong><em>So tell me about your book.</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> I think what makes it unique is that I'm focusing 
              on the history of relations between lesbians and gay men. A lot 
              of the other studies coming out are either on lesbians or on gay 
              men or they lump both groups together without trying to explore 
              their differences.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: </strong><em>I assume that you're not just focusing 
              on the bars?</em><br>
              <strong>A: </strong>My work for my degree at Penn focused on public 
              controversies and political activism; for the book, I'm trying to 
              layer in much more information about everyday life. Right now, actually, 
              I'm doing a little map of all the sites I've identified in Philadelphia 
              &#8212; so that includes not only the bars and restaurants, but 
              I have a mailing list of a gay group from the early 1970s with addresses 
              for several hundred residences, so I can really see on the map where 
              gay men lived and where lesbians lived.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: </strong><em>Is it true that gay men&#8212;who can afford 
              it&#8212;live on Pine Street and Spruce Street in Center City, while 
              lesbians live in Mount Airy and the Art Museum Area?</em><br>
              <strong>A: </strong>I think theres an element of truth to that stereotype. 
              Center City's been gay, as far as I can tell, back for 100 years. 
              Lesbians also lived in Center City, but they were not, perhaps, 
              as visible to the straight world as gay men.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: </strong><em>Has all this changed the way you see Philadelphia?</em><br>
              <strong>A: </strong>Yeah, absolutely. I walk through Rittenhouse 
              Square probably every other day, and some of the most colorful descriptions 
              that I have of lesbian and gay life in the '50s and '60s center 
              around Rittenhouse Square. I walk, smiling, when I go through the 
              park, just imagining what it was like. It really gives the lie to 
              the idea that lesbian and gay life was utterly miserable before 
              Stonewall. People describe an incredibly vibrant outdoor scene with 
              gay men promenading around the outside of the park, sitting on the 
              benches, cruising one another &#8212; lots of black drag queens; 
              it was a pretty racially mixed scene. Another interesting thing 
              about Rittenhouse Square is that almost all the gay men I interviewed 
              say they don't remember lesbians being there. But the majority of 
              the lesbians that I interviewed from that era have given me stories 
              of cruising there, hanging out with gay male friends there, coming 
              out there. It's one of those fascinating instances of the way gay 
              men just can not see lesbians, and also of the way lesbians so often 
              have built their world around, on the side of, gay male culture 
              &#8212; that is until the women's movement when there began to be 
              more of an independent lesbian culture.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: </strong><em>Tell me about some of the public controversies 
              you discuss in the book.</em><br>
              <strong>A: </strong>Well, in 1954 the Delaware River Port Authority 
              was in the process of overseeing the building of a new bridge. In 
              1955 the Catholic Church in South Jersey organized a major campaign 
              against naming the bridge for Walt Whitman. There was a series of 
              articles in the <em>Catholic Star Herald</em>, a Catholic newspaper 
              in South Jersey, and in the last of those articles, the author, 
              who was a priest, specifically said that one of the reasons that 
              the Church objected to Whitman was that he was homoerotic. One of 
              the really interesting things about this controversy is that, while 
              the <em>New York Times</em> was open about the reasons behind the 
              Catholic campaign, the local Philadelphia newspapers never mentioned 
              homosexuality &#8212; they questioned Whitman's stature as a poet, 
              they said that he was objectionable to the Catholic Church, but 
              never said why. The City of Gloucester threatened to put up signs 
              with their own name for the bridge on their side of the bridge, 
              but in the end, the Port Authority stuck to its guns. The other 
              controversy in the '50s occurred in 1959, when Philadelphia developed 
              its own beatnik coffeehouse scene, with four coffee houses right 
              around Rittenhouse Square: the Humoresque, the Proscenium, the Gilded 
              Cage, and the Artists Hut. That was back when Frank Rizzo was a 
              police captain, and he conducted a series of raids. One of the coffeehouse 
              owners filed a civil rights suit against the police. He not only 
              lost the case, but was forced out of business and subject to police 
              harassment. And, while the suit resulted in Rizzo being transferred 
              out of Center City, he was promoted to Inspector, and the whole 
              thing became a critical episode in his rise to power.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: </strong><em>What kind of obstacles have you encountered 
              doing this study?</em><br>
              <strong>A: </strong>Well, a lot of the book is based on oral histories, 
              and the group that is most difficult for me to find are people who 
              can talk about the '40s. That's obviously because they're older, 
              which either means that they're no longer with us or that they're 
              less connected to the very youth-oriented lesbian and gay scene. 
              The easiest group for me to find have been white lesbians and gay 
              men from the '70s. Older people, African Americans, working-class 
              people, people who were into the butch-femme bar scene, and non-activists&#8212;I've 
              interviewed people in each of those groups, but if any of your readers 
              fit that bill I would love to talk with them.</td>
