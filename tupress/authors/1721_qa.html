		<tr>
          <td colspan="2" valign="top"><p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>In your Introduction, 
                you write, &quot;My mother's hip is every mother's hip.&quot; 
                What made you decide to write this book about your caregiving 
                experiences, and why did you choose both the diary and lesson 
                format?</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> My point was that the typical patient does 
                not exist&#151;women who break hips tend to be in poor health 
                to begin with and have various medical problems that complicate 
                their recovery. I wanted readers to understand how complicated 
                a hip fracture could be, and thus I chose to tell not just my 
                mother's personal story, but also about the issues that invariably 
                crop up. 
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>There are some incredibly tense moments 
                in your experiences caring for your aging parents and handling 
                the stress of dealing with your family, caregivers, as well as 
                the hospital and nursing home staffs. How difficult was it to 
                recall these events, memories and conversations? Was it therapeutic 
                at all?</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> I think I ran on nervous energy as I tried 
                to juggle the many responsibilities of caring for my family. I 
                had to be strong for my ailing father and put on a good show for 
                my mother too. You don't want your own anxiety about the outcome 
                to be reflected in your mannerisms. I knew I had to be charming 
                to the medical staff no matter how upset I was so that my mother 
                would receive the best possible care. Some of the memories are 
                still so painful, I'd like to bury them, but time does help and 
                I felt that a burden had been lifted when I finished my book.</p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Your book describes some pretty detailed 
                surgical procedures and shows the physical effects of medicine 
                and treatment. You did not shy away from showing illness at its 
                worst. This is truly one of the strengths of your book. Can you 
                discuss why you decided to tell it like it is?</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> I knew that if I were to write credibly about 
                hip fractures, as I did in Lesson 1 (Hip Fracture, The Silent 
                Killer), I would have to start with surgical procedures. So I 
                scrubbed up and took my notebook and pencil into the operating 
                room. I wanted everybody to know how devastating a hip fracture 
                can be&#8212;not just the trauma of emergency surgery, but also 
                the loss of independence because one happened to have had the 
                bad luck of falling and breaking a bone. But the broken bone is 
                just the start of a long medical adventure; the hip fracture is 
                a sort of metaphor for what happens to older people when they 
                get caught up in the medical merry-go-round because of an acute 
                illness.</p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>So you're not only talking about hip 
                fractures when you show illness at its worst?</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> No, almost every issue I've discussed in regard 
                to hip fractures could be said for elderly patients with other 
                advanced debilitating diseases. Elderly patients do not have the 
                resilience that younger patients have, and often find themselves 
                helplessly mired in a series of medical crises that can contribute 
                to their swift decline. It's important for the patient's caregiver 
                or advocate to be aware of the issues before they crop up.</p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Your book raises awareness about hip 
                fractures, osteoporosis, eating to live, and most significantly, 
                the importance of maintaining one's mental health when dealing 
                with disease. How knowledgeable were you about these issues before 
                you began this book? Did any of your findings surprise you?</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> I think I earned a symbolic Ph.D. in hip fractures 
                while working on <em>My Mother's Hip</em>. I spent many months 
                in the medical libraries of New York City and interviewed dozens 
                of specialists. And I also followed a lot of patients around to 
                see how they dealt with their hip fractures. I was shocked by 
                some of my findings. I did not know, for instances, that because 
                people are living longer, the number of hip fractures has doubled 
                over the past twenty years, I did not know that only about 25 
                percent of hip fracture victims recover, and I did not know that 
                it is the one orthopedic injury that can lead to death.</p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>There are some very interesting scenes 
                of you dealing with your family and/or caregivers in which you 
                (or they) do not come off in the best light. Did you have any 
                concerns about writing so frankly about these arguments? What 
                did your family think about being the subject of </em>My Mother's 
                Hip<em> and the approach you took in depicting personal conversations?</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> I wrote <em>My Mother's Hip</em> to inform 
                the public about critical medical issues, not to harm to anybody 
                in my family. My mother would have approved and that was enough 
                for me. I wrote frankly about sibling dissension in Lesson 3 (Who 
                Cares?), because it is so common. Caring for an ill parent is 
                extremely stressful; it is not the same as planning a happy occasion 
                like a fiftieth wedding anniversary. The issue of family disagreements 
                has to come out of the closet, because we will all be better caregivers 
                in the end.</p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Perhaps the most important question you 
                ask in </em>My Mother's Hip<em>&#8212;and a constant refrain&#8212;concerns 
                hospital policy. From &quot;Why didn't the medical staff prepare 
                us for this?&quot; to facts about early discharges as being a 
                big contributor to the failure rate in hip fracture patients. 
                </em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> Medicare reimburses the hospital for five 
                days of acute care for a hip fracture. After that, the patient 
                becomes a liability because the hospital must pick up the tab. 
                So hospitals are motivated to discharge patients sooner rather 
                than later. Premature discharges are often detrimental to the 
                patient's best interests. That's where the nursing home comes 
                in&#8212;patients are not ready to go home, so they are discharged 
                to a nursing home to continue recuperating. </p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>How do you feel people with ailing parents 
                can best provide for the stress and strain of dealing with nursing 
                homes? You write that you rarely found anything positive about 
                American nursing homes in your research.</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> Nursing homes are undergoing a revolution 
                because they are picking up the slack from early hospital discharges 
                and learning how to specialize in all kinds of complicated medical 
                care. In this sense, the nursing home has an important role to 
                play in the American medical system. But the traditional nursing 
                home, the type discussed in Lesson 4 (Nursing Homes are Dangerous 
                to Your Health), has received the scorn of numerous muckrakers. 
                Even after sweeping reforms and controls were instituted, the 
                traditional nursing home continued to offer little nursing and 
                was repeatedly cited for deficiencies like neglecting patients' 
                needs, disregarding their rights, and providing substandard care.</p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Is that the reason why you talk about 
                alternative forms of residential design for the elderly?</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> Definitely! I am horrified by the notion that 
                people are sent to nursing homes just because they are old and 
                frail. Our society can definitely do better for their aging citizens. 
                We can make provisions for allowing the elderly to &quot;age in 
                place&quot; by bringing supportive care into the home and building 
                residential communities that offer a gamut of services. </p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>You debate the issues of prolonged living 
                and prolonged dying. This addresses your Lesson &quot;Who Decides?&quot; 
                How have your attitudes about these issues changed as a result 
                of your experiences/writing this book?</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> I still don't have any clear answers for determining 
                whether medical professionals prolong living or prolong dying. 
                The tendency is to err on the side of prolonging living. I've 
                suggested some formulas in lesson 5 (Enough is Enough) for weighing 
                the benefits of treatment against the disadvantages. People should 
                make their wishes clear in their advance directives and discuss 
                these matters with their physicians and families when they are 
                fairly well so that technology is not overzealously used in the 
                midst of a crisis to prolong dying.</p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>One of the most moving sections of </em>My 
                Mother's Hip<em> is your relationship with your mother. You describe 
                her as &quot;two separate entities&quot;: &quot;vibrant,&quot; 
                and &quot;sick, trapped in a failing body.&quot; Perhaps the most 
                telling comment in your book is when you write &quot;In truth, 
                I did not feel anyone would watch over Mother the way I could.&quot; 
                This speaks to the fact that you are a &quot;dutiful daughter.&quot; 
                What can you say was most rewarding about caring for your mother?</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> I was lucky to have had a lovely woman for 
                a mother. She was way ahead of her times and supported me in all 
                my endeavors without qualms. I didn't have to think very hard 
                about caring for her when she needed me; it was something I had 
                to do. I guess that makes me a &quot;dutiful daughter.&quot; Perhaps 
                I alleviated some of her suffering because she knew she could 
                count on me. I'm still convinced that hired hands and institutions 
                cannot replace the warmth of one's own family.</td>
