          <td colspan="2" valign="top"> <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>What do you 
                think your greatest achievement as a woman, specifically a transsexual 
                has been?</em> <br>
                <strong>A:</strong> Well, Honey, it certainly wouldn't be parading 
                around as a Playboy bunny&#8212;or even working in film and television, 
                although I loved that. I do think I've done some very important 
                work as a teacher, but my greatest achievement as a woman has 
                to be coming to grips with my place in society. That can be a 
                difficult task even for genetic women. Society sends mixed messages 
                about what it means to be a woman. 
              <p> <strong>Q:</strong> <em>Do you see yourself a transsexual pioneer? 
                </em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> Oh, Mercy! Thinking of myself as a pioneer 
                conjures up images of me wearing a coon skin cap. I am from Tennessee, 
                like Davy Crockett, but I would hope that's where the resemblance 
                ends. I merely see myself as a woman who, in order to live as 
                one, had to go to some fairly extreme measures. 
              <p> <strong>Q:</strong> <em>So speaking in terms of self-identification 
                and personal success, how do you view your role in society? </em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> My role is no different from the role of any 
                good citizen. I strive to be the best , most productive person 
                that I can be. I am not especially ambitious, but that probably 
                has nothing to do with gender. No, I see transsexual surgery as 
                a medical solution to a birth defect. It's not a reason for self-aggrandizement 
                nor does it offer the transgendered a segregated role in society. 
                My personal goal is grow into just another grand-old-dame. 
              <p> <strong>Q:</strong> <em>Can you give some marital advice to 
                women who are in bad, or seemingly difficult situations such as 
                you were?</em> <br>
                <strong>A:</strong> With hindsight, which is always 20/20, I can 
                see that a lot of my marital problems were of my own making. I 
                was not being honest, even with myself. I was trying to be the 
                woman my mate wanted me to be. By trying to live up to someone 
                else's fantasy, I lost myself. I know a lot of married women who 
                are still making that sad mistake. 
              <p> <strong>Q:</strong> <em>Are people shocked when they learn the 
                &quot;truth&quot; about you? </em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> Telling the truth about my past is still a 
                new experience for me. Coming out was not an easy decision, you 
                know. My ego is still so strong that I'd be hurt if strangers 
                did not react with shock when they learned the &quot;truth&quot; 
                of my gender history. Even at 63, old enough to know better, I 
                still want to be a femme fatal. 
              <p> <strong>Q:</strong> <em>If you had such success as a drag queen/female 
                impersonator, why did you make the decision to have surgery? </em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> Because I felt incomplete as a man. I always 
                believed that I was a woman&#8212;it was just a matter of making 
                that a reality. 
              <p> <strong>Q:</strong> <em>Sexual reassignment is still a very 
                controversial issue in this country. How do you think attitudes 
                have changed-for better or for worse-since your operation?</em> 
                <br>
                <strong>A:</strong> Attitudes have indeed changed since my sexual 
                reassignment-they've gotten worse. In the beginning (excuse me 
                if I sound biblical) there were so few of us that we created very 
                little hoopla. Generally speaking, people were not threatened. 
                Curious maybe, but not threatened. We were simply a few ultra 
                feminine individuals, labeled male at birth, who fervently desired 
                to live our lives at the women we knew ourselves to be. As we 
                graciously slipped into society, we didn't make waves. That has 
                changed. I think that is largely because the media spotlight has 
                focused on an angry, in-your-face, crass transsexual fringe. I 
                find that sad fact disheartening. 
              <p> <strong>Q:</strong> <em>Do you ever miss being a man?</em> <br>
                <strong>A:</strong> How can I miss something I never realized 
                I had? That's intended to be interpreted in the broadest sense, 
                you must understand. I never thought of myself as a man. From 
                my side of the fence, it takes more than a penis to be a man. 
                Do I miss a penis? Only on cold, lonely nights. 
              <p> <strong>Q:</strong> <em>What is sex like as a transsexual?</em> 
                <br>
                <strong>A:</strong> How badly do you want to know? 
              <p> <strong>Q:</strong> <em>What does the future hold for Aleshia? 
                </em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> Do you mean other than being universally loved 
                and adored? Ha! &#8212;wouldn't that be nice? Actually, I don't 
                know where my next steps will lead. I never have known. Any success 
                I might have found as a woman, or as a transsexual, if you prefer, 
                comes from getting up each morning, putting one well shod foot 
                in front of the other, and getting on with life. It just so happened 
                that my shoes had to be stilettos. I believe we're put on a path 
                at the very beginning of our journey. When we stray too far to 
                the left or to the right-the universe slaps us back to where we 
                are supposed to be.</td>
