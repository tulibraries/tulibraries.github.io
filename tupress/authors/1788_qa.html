              you to assemble </em>Challenging the Chip<em>? Where did you learn 
              about the stories that are included in the book? </em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> The book grew out of a global symposium sponsored 
              by the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition (SVTC) and the International 
              Campaign for Responsible Technology (ICRT) in 2002 where people 
              from 15 countries came together to share experiences and common 
              challenges. We realized that we had important stories to bring to 
              the attention of the general public, policymakers, communities, 
              workers, and others around the world. Many of the communities most 
              affected by negative high-tech impacts have been at the forefront 
              of creating solutions. <em>Challenging the Chip</em> brings these 
              stories together to document the incredibly brave and important 
              efforts of many people over the last three decades. In addition, 
              the book provides some direction and hope for a more sustainable 
              future for all of us.
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Would you describe </em>Challenging the 
              Chip<em> as an expos&eacute; of the electronics industry?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> <em>Challenging the Chip</em> definitely exposes 
              the dark side of the electronics revolution. In fact, the book includes 
              the most comprehensive documentation ever published about the negative 
              impacts that the electronics industry has had on communities around 
              the globe. However, it is also about the bright side, written by 
              people who have come together in workplaces, communities, and across 
              borders to prompt the industry to examine the impacts to the environment 
              and people's health, and the social injustice towards workers in 
              the manufacturing of its products. <em>Challenging the Chip</em> 
              is about challenging the industry to use its incredible ingenuity 
              to dazzle the world all over again with cleaner, greener technologies, 
              products, and components that are free of toxics, easy to recycle, 
              and produced without harm to those manufacturing, assembling, and 
              disassembling them.</p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Your book talks about issues of health, 
              environment, labor, and social justice. What do you think are the 
              most important concerns within the electronics industry? </em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> First, electronic products today are manufactured 
              using more than a thousand toxic chemicals&#8212;many of which are 
              known to cause cancers, miscarriages, reproductive problems, asthma, 
              and other illnesses in the workers who make them, the communities 
              surrounding the manufacturing facilities, and the places where e-waste 
              is dumped and burned.</p>
            <p> Secondly, the industry's &quot;planned obsolescence&quot; of electronic 
              products, makes it almost impossible to repair or upgrade existing 
              machines, forcing consumers to buy the latest model and throw out 
              the old one. The rapid pace of change is a real double-edged sword 
              because new chemicals are being incorporated before adequate health 
              testing is done, and we are also consuming faster than we can recycle.</p>
            <p> Lastly, there has been a migration of high-tech facilities to 
              impoverished developing countries with weak environmental and worker 
              protections. This increases the power and profitability of electronics 
              firms at the expense of local communities and workers&#8212;many 
              of whom are young women of color&#8212;around the world.</p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>You talk about &quot;providing a vision 
              of what a sustainable electronics industry can look like&quot; in 
              the book. How viable is this? </em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> It's entirely possible, but only if people are 
              aware and come together to make the changes happen. The electronics 
              industry is incredibly dynamic and has shown it is capable of change. 
              Organizations like the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition and efforts 
              like the Computer TakeBack Campaign have moved companies like Dell 
              (see Chapter 25) to take back and recycle their products. Today, 
              Dell offers free recycling of any brand computer from anywhere in 
              the world when you buy a new Dell. That's enormous progress from 
              where they were just a few years ago! An industry that's been able 
              to put thousands of songs, photos, and videos on a tiny chip has 
              the capacity to pave the way towards a sustainable future.</p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Do you think it is possible to change such 
              a powerful and pervasive industry?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> The stories in the book are written by progressive 
              visionaries, scholars, and advocates in the field from all around 
              the world who have already succeeded in bringing about change in 
              the industry over a number of years, using a diverse range of tactics, 
              including grassroots organizing, consumer education, market-based 
              campaigning, litigation, health advocacy, shareholder initiatives, 
              and government regulation. Until now, many of these stories have 
              never been told, let alone gathered in a single text. </p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>You profile several people and organizations 
              around the world. What similarities&#8212;or differences&#8212;do 
              you see in the industry and how each country handles the issues 
              of labor, environment, and technology?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> <em>Challenging the Chip</em> describes similarities 
              in the &quot;environmental footprint&quot; of high-tech development&#8212;worker 
              health hazards, groundwater contamination, and air pollution&#8212;whether 
              in California, Texas, Scotland, Taiwan, or Mexico. In Chapter 14, 
              labor rights in Mexico are described in depth, showing the violations 
              in the length of the work day, the poor wages, as well as issues 
              of discrimination, harassment, and other basic human rights. Likewise, 
              the photos in Chapter 21, show things like a child in India sorting 
              through discarded electronic circuit boards without proper protection. 
              The book also addresses the critical questions of the long term 
              impacts of electronics manufacturing in China and India, where so 
              much of the production and disposal are now occurring.</p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>You fill this book with &quot;people's 
              histories.&quot; What story moved you the most? </em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> I am most moved by the story about Helen Clark, 
              Jim McCourt, and their colleagues in Silicon Glen, Scotland (Chapter 
              12). Their persistence, courage, and ingenuity moved the Scottish 
              government to conduct the world's most comprehensive health study 
              of semiconductor workers. Their efforts have helped make working 
              conditions in the industry safer and healthier not only in Scotland 
              but around the world. It's very sad that Helen gave up her life 
              in this struggle, but her spirit is still with us, and she is still 
              inspiring others to action. </p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> Challenging the Chip<em> is an excellent handbook 
              and reference guide for learning more about the global electronics 
              industry. What are some important resources people should use to 
              take action and become change-makers themselves?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> The book includes a comprehensive list of organizations, 
              resources, and websites for readers to follow up their interests 
              in working with others to change electronics in more healthy, environmentally-friendly, 
              and socially just ways. Such resources are growing rapidly, as the 
              leading groups continue to expand their work and as new groups become 
              more involved. These resources will be regularly updated on the 
              Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition's website, <a href="http://www.svtc.org/" target="new">www.svtc.org</a>, 
              which will serve as a clearing house and network hub for a variety 
              of newly-emerging initiatives.<br>
