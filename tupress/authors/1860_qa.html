            <p><strong>In this Q&A, Temple University Press author Andrew Zimbalist makes his observations and arguments on the sports business.</strong></td>

		<tr>
          <td colspan="2"><p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>&quot;Following the money&quot; 
              seems to be a good way of following sports. Why do you feel this 
              has been the case? </em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> Sports today is big business. If you don't follow 
              the money, you don't understand the sport, you don't understand 
              why teams sign one free agent and not another, why they make trades, 
              why they seek new stadiums or arenas. It would be like trying to 
              understand U.S. foreign policy without considering oil. 
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Can you discuss players' salaries skyrocketing? 
              Has this always been the case? Was Babe Ruth the A-Rod of his day? 
              You indicate that Michael Jordan was actually worth his $33M in 
              1997 because he generated extra revenue for the Bulls. What conclusions 
              can you make about the trend over time? Are the players by and large 
              really worth it? </em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> Since free agency came to sports labor markets, 
              players'salaries have skyrocketed to approximate their values. Jordan 
              was actually worth more than $33M to the NBA in 1997. The secret 
              is that sports leagues actually do need some mechanisms to curtail 
              free market outcomes.</p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>The Yankees are often criticized for &quot;buying 
              their team,&quot; and you discuss the importance of one franchise 
              not dominating the league. How do you&#8212;and teams&#8212;react 
              to these kinds of suggestions? </em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> In my view, the Yankees are playing by the rules. 
              They also haven't won the World Series since 2000, and they are 
              the club that other teams love to beat. All sports leagues need 
              mechanisms to promote balance on the field. In baseball it is revenue 
              sharing, but until now, MLB's system has not had the right incentives. 
              Baseball needs to redesign its sharing, not criticize owners who 
              seek (and achieve) success.</p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>The World Series, The Super Bowl, The Olympics. 
              In your opinion what sports event seems to be most affected, or 
              burdened by economic issues? </em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> Add some more: the NCAA finals, The Word Cup.... 
              Money is front and center for all of them. <br>
              <br>
              <strong>Q:</strong> <em>In one essay, you discuss that Seattle had 
              record home attendance in 1991, but that the city almost lost the 
              league. How can such ironic things happen? Should fan-owned teams, 
              like the Green Bay Packers, be the future of ownership? </em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> Fan- or city-owned teams is a lovely idea&#8212;one 
              that accords with the hundreds of millions of dollars of public 
              subsidies and extensive free media coverage that teams receive, 
              but the major sports leagues in the U.S. do not allow it for a controlling 
              interest in the franchise. The Packers' structure dates back to 
              the early 1920s and is grandfathered by the NFL. </p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>You talk about &quot;owners treating teams 
              not as a profit center but a means to generat[e] profits for their 
              other investments.&quot; What is the benefit of this when it&#8212;as 
              you suggest&#8212;mostly generates tensions between players and 
              owners? </em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> Sports teams, because of their cultural prominence, 
              provide great leverage to their owners. Ownership gains instant 
              connections to an area's media, politicians, and businesses. It 
              offers opportunities to establish or develop related companies, 
              such as regional sports channels. Teams also offer substantial tax 
              sheltering benefits. To understand whether buying a team is a good 
              investment, one must go well beyond the reported bottom line on 
              the team's income statement. </p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>When you see a half empty stadium, how 
              does a franchise goose sales? The NBA, you write in one essay, did 
              OK in 2001 when they weren't doing so hot as a league. Is it just 
              a bad team, or it is sometimes the apathy of the citizens? How do 
              mediocre clubs turn a profit? You don't hear about too many teams 
              in an established league failing. </em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> It varies league by league, but all leagues 
              have shared revenue. In the NFL, the shared revenue in 2006 exceeds 
              $130 million per team. The shared revenue enables mediocre teams 
              to stay afloat and sometimes earn profits. </p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>You write much about labor relations and 
              lockouts. When teams strike for more money, it seems that the fans 
              are the ones who lose. </em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> Yes, fans lose, but so do the owners and the 
              players. The typical player has a major league career of three to 
              five years, depending on the league, and an average salary of $1.5 
              to 4.5 million. With such short careers and obscene salaries, players, 
              these days, are loathe to strike. </p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>You write that, &quot;the college sports 
              system has elements that are both hypocritical and corrupt,&quot; 
              and your analysis of Jeremy Bloom's situation resonates. How can 
              folks be so shortsighted over not spending dollars that make no 
              sense? </em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> There are no easy answers to the contradictions 
              and economic irrationality of big-time college sports. Basically 
              the system perpetuates itself and grows because of entrenched interests 
              and the absence of a political coalition to do anything about it. 
            </p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Do you think that the greed in the industry 
              will ever by curbed? Can ticket prices ever be raised so high that 
              no one will pay them? Are companies who buy box seats really bearing 
              the cost for owner's making a profit (at the expense of fans)?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> Like most businesses, sports teams need to follow 
              the market. Although some owners get carried away, and although 
              sports leagues have more pricing power due to their monopoly status, 
              the greed in the sports industry is generally no different than 
              anywhere else in our economy. </p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>How do you think the steroid scandals, 
              player strikes, and other hindrances are affecting sports? What 
              is the lasting impact of these events, and how can sports be improved 
              to avoid them? </em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> The steroid problem will not go away anytime 
              soon. New compounds, masking agents, and delivery systems assure 
              this, as does the prospect for gene doping a few years down the 
              road. The problem of performance enhancers has been around for decades, 
              not just in sports but throughout our society&#8212;ask any college 
              student studying for finals on speed. Fans basically seem to be 
              forgiving about player transgressions. <br>
