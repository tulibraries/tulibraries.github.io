            <p><strong>Q&A with William Quigley, author of <em>Ending 
                Poverty as We Know It</em></strong></td>
        </tr>
		<tr>
          <td colspan="2" valign="top"> <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>You propose 
                a constitutional amendment guaranteeing every person the right 
                to a job at a living wage. How is this better than advocating 
                for another increase in the minimum wage?</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> I think this proposal is better in at least 
                three ways. First, it creates the goal of a living wage, not a 
                minimum wage. The minimum wage is roughly half what a living wage 
                would be. Under this approach, people are entitled to a living 
                wage. Second, it links the right to a living wage with the right 
                to a job. A right to a living wage is no good if you don't have 
                a job that pays it. This guarantees everyone who wants to work 
                the opportunity to do so. Third, by putting both the right to 
                a living wage and the right to a job into the constitution it 
                sets up a permanent method for enforcing these rights. It now 
                literally takes an act of congress to raise the pitifully low 
                minimum wage. If these rights are placed into our constitution, 
                there would be many ways to make sure they are met. 
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>What is the minimum wage now? Has the 
                minimum wage kept up with the cost of living? How have minimum 
                wage workers fared when you look at the value of the minimum wage 
                today compared to prior decades?</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> The minimum wage is $5.15 an hour. It has 
                not kept up with inflation and has not been raised for years. 
                If today's minimum wage was worth as much as the minimum wage 
                was in the late 1960s, it would be over $8.00 an hour. Minimum 
                wage workers did much better in past decades than they are doing 
                now. They are going backwards, fast.</p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Exactly how much money are you proposing 
                we pay our minimum wage earners? In other words, what is a &quot;living 
                wage?&quot; How did you derive it?</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> I suggest a living wage is at least $10.50 
                an hour for a single worker with no dependents if the employer 
                does not pay health insurance, and $8.50 an hour if the employer 
                pays for health insurance. If the worker is supporting children, 
                then the living wage would have to be higher. The additional money 
                for workers supporting family members could be put into their 
                paychecks by tax credits. The actual hourly dollar figure for 
                the living wage is arrived at by figuring out how much it actually 
                costs to support yourself. Many organizations have calculated 
                the actual cost of supporting yourself, that is where the figure 
                comes from.</p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>We have been led to believe that there 
                is no way we can guarantee good jobs at good wages for our citizens 
                because the free market will not allow it. What do you mean, &quot;there 
                is no free market&quot;?</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> I say that there is no such thing as a free 
                market because all of our markets have rules that help businesses 
                and others that require businesses to do something. Ask any accountant, 
                business lobbyist, or corporate lawyer. Business in this world 
                takes place in a highly structured setting. There are all kinds 
                of local, state, and federal laws and rules out there which help 
                businesses and employers. There are also some rules and regulations 
                which require them to do things they do not want to do. Every 
                single day in every single city council, state legislature and 
                in Congress, there are lobbyists and lawyers working to change 
                the rules and laws to benefit their business clients. There is 
                no company in the USA which does not take advantage of these tax 
                credits, special business opportunities, legislation and rules. 
                All this proposal is asking for is that one of the rules becomes 
                that every person have a right to work and to become self-supporting 
                by earning a living wage.</p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Opponents also argue that paying higher 
                wages is unaffordable for businesses, fuels inflation, and causes 
                higher unemployment as businesses respond to increased labor costs 
                by laying off workers. How do you reply to that?</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> The first response is that we are already 
                paying a very high cost for a system which allows low wages and 
                high unemployment. Each one of us is subsidizing low wage work 
                and unemployment right now, through our tax dollars, through our 
                churches and neighborhood organizations and all the other ways 
                that we pay for food, shelter, child care, medical care and transportation 
                for the poor. But it is true that here is no such thing as a free 
                lunch. What this means is that we as a society will have to pay 
                a price for giving every person the chance to work and earn enough 
                to support themselves and their families. Social security costs 
                money, medical care for the elderly costs money, but we have found 
                a way to make them work. Though they still have problems we have 
                always found ways to make them work and we always will. The same 
                will happen with this proposal. If the people want it, it will 
                happen and we will find the way. The second response is that people 
                ought to remember our history. Every single effort to make social 
                progress, from outlawing child labor to medicare to social security 
                to paying a minimum wage, has been opposed by people who say it 
                would fatally wreck the economy. Such criticism is expected. If 
                people agree that every person ought to have the right to a job 
                that pays a living wage, we can find a way to make it happen without 
                wrecking the economy.</p>
              <p> <strong>Q:</strong> <em>Tell us about other times in U.S. history 
                when a guaranteed right to employment or a living wage was seriously 
                considered. What did Thomas Pane propose in 1791? Tell us a few 
                of the many things Franklin Delano Roosevelt said about full employment 
                at a living wage.</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> Making sure that every person has a chance 
                to work and earn a living wage is not a new idea. In 1791 Thomas 
                Paine published <em>The Rights of Man</em> and proposed that the 
                government set up places where anyone who wanted to work could 
                find a job. They would be paid room and board plus some money 
                for working, no questions asked. Since the 1800s cities such as 
                Baltimore, New York, Philadelphia and others have set up public 
                works projects to give people jobs when unemployment was high. 
                In 1937 FDR said it was time that our nation &#8220;should be 
                able to devise ways and means of insuring to all our able bodied 
                working men and women a fair day&#8217;s pay for a fair day&#8217;s 
                work.&#8221;</p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Isn't amending the Constitution a hard, 
                time-consuming and politically demanding task? How specifically 
                would the process of implementing your proposed amendment operate?</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> Yes, amending the Constitution is tough and 
                takes time. The Constitution is our promise to ourselves and we 
                take it seriously so it should not be lightly changed. That is 
                exactly why a constitutional amendment is needed. This discussion 
                has to happen in all 50 states and in both houses of congress. 
                It is a big step. It is an important step. And it should not happen 
                unless the people want it to happen. The first step is to start 
                a serious discussion about what our nation<br>
                wants for the people who work and still are poor. We have not 
                had that discussion. We have talked for years about moving people 
                off of welfare into jobs. Now we need to take the next step and 
                talk about moving people who work and are still poor out of poverty. 
                Most everyone I know of agrees that people ought to have the chance 
                to work if they want to and ought to be able to support themselves 
                and their families if they work. We need to start figuring out 
                how to make that happen. This amendment will add to that discussion.</p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>You maintain that &quot;most of what 
                the general public believes about poverty and work is inaccurate.&quot; 
                What do you mean? Many people think that the lack of education 
                is keeping some people out of the job market. How do you respond 
                to this claim?</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> I think there are many common myths about 
                poverty out there. Many people think the solution to poverty is 
                for people to get a job. That is just plain wrong. Tens of millions 
                of people are already working and they are still poor. Lack of 
                education is certainly a problem that our nation needs to address. 
                But should people have to wait for jobs or decent wages until 
                our nation solves our educational problems? I don&#8217;t think 
                so. Each person, no matter what their education, deserves respect 
                as a human being. If a person is poorly educated or undereducated, 
                they are still a person. They are still parents. They deserve 
                a chance to work and support themselves and their families while 
                we as a nation work on our educational problems.</p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Some theorists think that millions of 
                unemployed are good for the nation. In fact, the current policy 
                of the Federal Reserve nearly dictates that some percentage of 
                the workforce must be unemployed in order to fight inflation. 
                How do you respond to those arguments?</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> You are right that some economists think that 
                the nation has to have several million people out of work in order 
                to keep inflation down. I think most people think that is wrong. 
                We cannot in fairness say that millions of workers have to be 
                denied the chance to work so that those of us who are employed 
                will be better off. The unemployed are people just like us, they 
                just don&#8217;t have jobs. I think we as a nation can find a 
                way to allow every person to work and earn a living wage if we 
                put our minds to it. That is why this needs to be in the constitution, 
                to keep the importance of jobs at good wages always on our national 
                agenda.</p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>How has Clinton-era welfare reform affected 
                the working poor?</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> Welfare reform was very good at changing non-working 
                poor people into working poor people. It was not very good at 
                changing working poor people into working people who can earn 
                enough to support themselves and their families.</p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Why is the minimum wage not indexed for 
                inflation, while Social Security is?</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> Political pressure made Congress index Social 
                Security benefits so they rose each year with inflation. That 
                is exactly what it will take to create a living wage and to allow 
                it to rise each year with inflation.</p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Adding the guarantee of a right to a 
                job with a living wage to the Constitution will not instantly 
                make that a reality. What will bring it about?</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> Putting an idea into the constitution, like 
                the right to vote, does not automatically make it happen. It takes 
                Congress, the Executive Branch, the Courts, and ultimately the 
                people to make that promise a reality. Putting it into the Constitution 
                is a big step, but you are right, it is only the first of many.</p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>How popular are movements for living 
                wages? About how many jurisdictions in the country currently have 
                living wage ordinances? About how many other are working on enacting them? What is the substance 
                of most of these ordinances?</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> Living wage laws have been passed by more 
                than 75 cities in the US. They are very popular with cities and 
                voters. They are very unpopular with low-wage industries like 
                the restaurant and hotel lobbies who have tried in courts and 
                in state legislatures to make cities stop passing these laws. 
                Most living wage ordinances say that any business doing business 
                with the city has to pay their employees living wages, usually 
                something in the neighborhood of what I am proposing, $10.50 an 
                hour if the do not pay health insurance, and less if they do pay 
                health insurance.<br>
