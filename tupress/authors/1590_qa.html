            <p><strong>The author of <em>Across 
                the Red Line</em> speaks about his experiences as a surgeon.</strong></td>
        </tr>
		<tr>
          <td colspan="2" valign="top"> <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Dr. Karl, 
                when you decided on a career in medicine&#8212;surgery, specifically&#8212;why 
                did you choose to become an Academic surgeon? (It couldn't have 
                been for the money!)</em> <br>
                <strong>A:</strong> Academic surgery has it all: research, teaching 
                and clinical care. It keeps you young. New students and residents 
                push me, make me better. I get to see the world through their 
                eyes, which protects me against the ennui many doctors feel. Plus, 
                the politics are much more intriguing. And, we're not underpaid.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Q:</strong> <em>So you've written </em>Across the Red 
                Line<em> after practicing medicine for 31 years. Do the cases 
                you relate in the book come from recent experiences, or over the 
                course of your career?</em> <br>
                <strong>A:</strong> I've collected these stories over a decade. 
                At first, I was too busy concentrating on the care of the patient 
                to let in the great drama I was witnessing. In time, I realized 
                I was seeing and experiencing things that moved me, so I started 
                writing them down. Initially it was haphazard, then I started 
                looking for things that fit into the pattern of the life I've 
                come to know. Now I've got other things I want to tell. 
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>The M&amp;M (Morbidity and Mortality) 
                session was very insightful about how doctors express their concerns 
                about their work. How typical was the one you presented in </em>Across 
                the Red Line<em>. I would think that these meetings can sometimes 
                get out of hand. Did you choose this specific one for any particular 
                reason?</em> <br>
                <strong>A:</strong> It is a pretty typical representation. It 
                was just the one that came along when I got the idea to write 
                about it. Now I run the conference, so it is my obligation to 
                keep things in bounds. I've let the medical students attend. I 
                think they learn a lot by watching the immediacy of the conference 
                and the difficult things that get discussed there. Everybody there 
                has made a mistake at one point and I try not to let them forget. 
              </p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>You sometime face frustrations with your 
                patients&#8212;Joe, who suffers a massive heart attack after a 
                successful kidney operation; or Sal, who injected cocaine through 
                a stent you provided&#8212;how do you recover from these &quot;losses&quot; 
                and move on to the next patient with the right frame of mind? 
                </em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> Loss is part of life. We live in a TV society 
                were loss is only temporary. But in real life it is permanent. 
                These losses make my life richer, fuller. I know that bad things 
                can happen. I sit at the bottom of the funnel. (Read my introduction!) 
                All this makes the usual everyday frustrations less compelling, 
                less important. Sadness is not all bad. </p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>You write in your introduction that most 
                of what you do is &quot;wait and respond&quot; is that patience 
                something you had to learn, or does it come naturally from watching 
                the body and its ability to heal? </em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> You've got no choice. The patients I'll operate 
                three weeks from now don't even know they have cancer yet. We've 
                got to wait to find out. </p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>At one point you describe being a patient 
                yourself. Did you find it difficult to be on the other side of 
                the &quot;red line&quot;?</em> <br>
                <strong>A:</strong> You bet. And this has given me a empathetic 
                insight to the patient's dilemma. They want to please me, but 
                it is I who must do a job for them. I view medical humor differently. 
                I have a much greater respect for how tired patients feel, how 
                scared they are. The young residents order chest x-rays for patients 
                with fevers, so that their superiors won't yell at them. But for 
                the patient, going down to the x-ray department, while they are 
                sick and weak is the equivalent of going to the moon. I have lots 
                more patience with patients!</td>
