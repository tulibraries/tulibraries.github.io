            <p><strong>Political Engagement as Therapy for the Intellect </strong>
            <p>By Danny Postel for <em>The Chronicle of Higher Education</em>, 
              3 May 2002</td>

		<tr>
          <td colspan="2" valign="top"> <p>The writing of one's life can offer 
                an &quot;explanatory myth&quot; at worst and an &quot;entertaining 
                tale&quot; at best, says Gerda Lerner, a professor emerita of 
                history at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. 
              <p><em>In Fireweed: A Political Autobiography</em> (Temple University 
                Press), she recounts the prehistory of her career in what she 
                calls the &quot;intellectual revolution&quot; of women's history, 
                a field on which she left a pioneering mark with such works as 
                The Woman in American History (1971), The Creation of Patriarchy 
                (1986), and The Creation of Feminist Consciousness (1993).</p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>You grew up in Austria in the 1920s and 
                '30s. How did that experience influence the development of your 
                political consciousness?</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> From an early age, I experienced revolution, 
                counterrevolution, military occupation, and fascism. I was imprisoned, 
                I was a hostage&#8212;I lived in great danger. I was essentially 
                struggling for my life. Living through this makes you very much 
                aware of politics as a force in life and of the need to struggle 
                for human rights. </p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>After the war, in America, you were active 
                in the Communist Party for a time and then left. You write that 
                it took you some years &quot;to think [your] way out, not of one 
                political movement only, but out of Marxism, the theory.&quot;</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> There was a period when, though I was disillusioned 
                with the Communist Party, I was still a Marxist. Then, after 1958, 
                when I began to study academically, I began to have serious problems 
                with the doctrine in regard to women. It was my feminism that 
                made me realize that Marxism was wrong.</p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>You went many decades without publicly 
                discussing this chapter in your life, the Communist years. Why 
                now?</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> Well, I'm 81 years old&#8212;when am I going 
                to do it if not now? I felt uneasy about evading the issue based 
                on fear. I felt that I owed it to myself and to the people who 
                have learned from me and respect me to tell them the whole story. 
                And I feel that there is something to be learned from my story.</p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>What, exactly, would you say that is?</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> That active political engagement is good for 
                thinking. If you are engaged in the world, you have a way of testing 
                your thinking. I tested Marxist thought. It didn't work.</p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>At the very end of the book, you say 
                that for many years you felt that you had nothing to apologize 
                for, but you go on to say that you feel differently about this 
                now. Why the change?</em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> We learned things that we did not know at 
                the time. I defended the Hitler-Stalin pact [over which thousands 
                of Communists left the party] at the time, and I'm sorry I did. 
                The decisions I made in my life seemed to have a good logic then, 
                even if 60 years later, that logic may not stand up.</td>
