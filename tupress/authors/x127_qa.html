              edited by Quang Bao and Hanya Yanagihara with Timothy Liu</p>
            <p><strong>Quang Bao, co-editor of <em>Take Out</em>, speaks out on 
              the features chosen for his new anthology and the diversity and 
              power seen in literary works and visual art from Queer Asian America.</strong></td>

          <td colspan="2" valign="top">
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Why did you include poetry, prose, drama, 
                and visual art all into one anthology? </em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> We wanted to be open to whatever work artists 
                wanted to send in. Writers are sometimes also visual artists, 
                poets, and performers all in one. Part of the joy of an anthology 
                is its diversity and the collection of different forms and genres. 
                
              <p> <strong>Q:</strong> <em>Was there a specific criteria-other 
                than being queer and Asian-that determined inclusion in TAKE OUT? 
                </em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> As we mentioned in the introduction, we had 
                a very laissez-faire policy towards the submissions. We didn't 
                want to impose any limitations, especially on themes. We received-I 
                don't know-several hundred submissions, and then we set out to 
                commission work from writers. 
              <p> <strong>Q:</strong> <em>You said in your introduction that you 
                wanted to feature as many &quot;unpublished&quot; voices as possibly, 
                yet TAKE OUT also includes work by established writers, such as 
                Mei Ng (Eating Chinese Food Naked). What balance were you looking 
                to achieve? </em>
              <br> <strong>A:</strong> We drew up a list of writers we admired 
                and wanted to include, not knowing exactly what would come to 
                us from the call for submissions, which went out nationally. I 
                think editors and readers are always interested in new voices. 
                The work by established authors running along side the work from 
                emerging writers augur well for the future of gay/lesbian Asian 
                American literature. 
              <p> <strong>Q:</strong> <em>The perspectives in TAKE OUT are quite 
                diverse. Does this book try to include all of the voices of queer 
                Asian America, or is it just representational of new experiences?</em> 
                <br>
                <strong>A:</strong> It shows off the range and diversity of talent 
                and experience. There are people we would have liked to include 
                but quite honestly I think we rounded up a very good group. You 
                might see differences too between what women write about and what 
                men write about or differences in writing from either coasts. 
                
              <p> <strong>Q:</strong> <em>It seems every country from India to 
                Japan is in TAKE OUT. Are there are any cultures that are missing, 
                or you hoped to include, but did not get any submissions?</em> 
                <br>
                <strong>A:</strong> Oh, we didn't pay attention to darting every 
                country on the board. You can't force writers into a book&#151;and 
                whose to say that a writer from Bangladesh is representative of 
                anything Bangladeshi&#151;and you certainly shouldn't have that mindset 
                just because you somehow feel that people not represented will 
                be offended. A book, even one of this size, cannot be all things 
                to all people. 
              <p> <strong>Q:</strong> <em>You say in your introduction that &quot;the 
                best anthology is one that makes you reconsider the genre and 
                audience it claims to represent.&quot; How does TAKE OUT attempt 
                to accomplish this?</em> <br>
                <strong>A:</strong> The inclusion of literary quality writing 
                that focuses on innumerable subjects in a fresh light. How open 
                a reader's mind becomes depends on where he or she starts out. 
                Above all politics, the book will be a wild ride for readers.</td>
