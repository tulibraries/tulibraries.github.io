		<tr>
          <td colspan="2" valign="top"> <p>Prelude to an interview from Tim 
                Miller... 
              <p>Okay, I admit it, I was definitely one of those queer boys who 
                got picked last&#8212;or on a good day next to last&#8212;for 
                every team sport except square dancing. With that trauma lurking 
                in my mind, I approached <em>Sportsex</em>, Toby Miller's remarkable 
                exploration of organized sports, erotics, and culture, with more 
                than a little trepidation. Instead of having to relive the terror 
                of seventh grade I was delighted to discover in <em>Sportsex</em> 
                a hugely enjoyable, smart and sexy examination of the role sports 
                and athletes play in the contemporary lesbian and gay sexual imagination. 
              </p>
              <p>Toby Miller guides us through this tricky terrain with great 
                joy and profound insights, fully aware of the mine field he has 
                found himself on. He writes in the introduction to <em>Sportsex</em>, 
                &quot;And there lies the secret of something alongside my hatred 
                of sports: the thrill when someone passes a football expertly 
                and you run onto it; the sensation of receiving a hard-hit stroke 
                and using its strength to return the ball to you colleague; the 
                fun of running alongside others; and the pleasure of swimming 
                in a creek with friends. Adrienne Rich refers to this as &quot;what 
                makes the body shoot into its pure and irresistible curve.' Such 
                joys are quite distant from the horror-show world of competition, 
                authority and critique that characterized the ritual humiliation 
                of schooldays.&quot; </p>
              <p><em>Sportsex</em> dares us to look anew at the huge cultural 
                motor of organized sports to see how it informs gay people's bodies, 
                sexuality and culture. I talked recently with Toby Miller about 
                sports, lesbian and gay erotic symbols and Ian Thorpe's body at 
                the Olympics. </p>
              <p>Tim Miller is a solo performer and the author of <em>Shirts &amp; 
                Skin</em>, published by Alyson. He can be reached at <a href="http://hometown.aol.com/millertale/timmiller.html" target="new">http://hometown.aol.com/<br>
                millertale/timmiller.html</a>.
              <p> <strong>Q:</strong> <em>As I read your remarkable book Sportsex, 
                I was struck that with all the extensive intellectual and critical 
                focus examining almost every aspect of popular culture, sports 
                has been largely left out. What led you to go to the forbidden 
                land of contemporary sports? </em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> I have been very concerned that cultural studies 
                has devoted a vast amount of energy and time to soap opera, reality 
                TV, hanging out in shopping malls, you name it, but has done very 
                little about the most prevalent form of popular culture in world 
                history. Sport is so important, both as something people watch 
                and something they do, as well. Bertolt Brecht once said a sports 
                arena was a place where you might start a revolution. Today, we're 
                more likely to see a new cable channel! Either way, it needs to 
                be addressed. Why the lack of interest? I think this neglect has 
                been because folks see sport as anti-intellectual, right-wing, 
                and unseemly. In gender terms, it's regarded by many people as 
                misogynistic and homophobic. But I perceive major changes in the 
                way sport and sexuality are unfolding. We live in an era when 
                commercial forces have permeated sport so thoroughly that men 
                are overtly exposed to a sexualizing gaze. Their bodies are objects 
                of sale to gay male and straight female spectators. The pressure 
                on the male body to look beautiful is now beginning to approximate 
                what women have suffered for generations. There are some positive 
                aspects to this change. Hence the book. It took me thirteen years 
                to get there, but now it's done! 
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>I was really haunted by what you wrote 
                in the introduction to </em>Sportsex<em> that &quot;beauty is 
                as much a part of male sports discourse today as toughness, while 
                grace is the avowed compatriot of violence.&quot; What did you 
                discover about this dynamic tension as you wrote </em>Sportsex<em>?</em> 
                <br>
                <strong>A:</strong> It is a dynamic tension. Sport is full of 
                weird contradictions. We are constantly told that it is all about 
                competition, but of course it's just as much about collaboration, 
                especially in team sports. We're told that it's a place where 
                the cream of talent and work rise to the top, but as the success 
                of wealthy sports teams and the failure of poor ones shows, that 
                success comes at a price. In aesthetic/sexual terms, we often 
                associate sports with aggression and power&#8212;a fast serve 
                in tennis, a right hook in boxing, a defensive tackle in football. 
                But it's also and equally about beauty&#8212;the mechanics of 
                the tennis shot, the taut bodies in boxing trunks, the tight pants 
                in football. And the two tendencies have become intertwined. So 
                just as the National Football League advertises itself as a tough, 
                &quot;real&quot; man's game, it now markets its players as sex 
                symbols whose mere appearance in their drag-like uniforms is a 
                sign of beauty (supposedly!). Of course, the tension is more complex 
                than that&#8212;the beauty is not so easily divorced from the 
                power. They work together. </p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>It's interesting to me that gay men's 
                almost universally negative experiences of organized sports in 
                childhood (the horror! the ball is coming to me!) is frequently 
                doubled in adult life with an erotic fascination for the bodies 
                of sports figures. The lesbian cliche of being in love with your 
                gym teacher brings up a whole other angle of how sports play out&#8212;as 
                it were&#8212;in our lives. What did you observe about how sports 
                both informs and provokes gay and lesbian erotics?</em> <br>
                <strong>A:</strong> Well, it's pretty clear from a lot of lesbian 
                writing that sports have been a venue for meeting people, forming 
                alliances, and creating community. Conversely, as you say, the 
                experience for gay men is often very alienating. That changed, 
                as the buff body of the '80s clone became fashionable, and the 
                reality of queer culture's ubiquity became clear. To hear a sports 
                commentator get excited over another man's performance is to hear 
                something very erotic. 'Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god. He's 
                done it! He's done it!' Remind you of anything? To me, it's akin 
                to a powerful orgasm. </p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>I love that! It does make me wonder what 
                was I really looking at when I saw Ian Thorpe's glamour shot in 
                </em>Newsweek<em> which was on my computer screen saver all last 
                fall? His body? His Australian body? (My partner is Aussie, so 
                I'm a sucker for that.) His Australian swimmer's body? His expensive 
                wrist watch on his Australian swimmer's body?</em> <br>
                <strong>A:</strong> Well, Tim, your powers of observation, and 
                pleasure in observing, are remarkable! Of course, you'd not have 
                seen the watch or the contours of Thorpe's trim, taut, and terrific 
                form if he hadn't been a swimmer of exceptional quality. And you'd 
                have seen much less of him prior to this era. Before, swimmers 
                were supposedly amateurs. Now, that hypocrisy has gone, and they 
                are up for sale. So that means you see him as a commercial figure 
                as well as an athletic one, although they are interdependent. 
                You see, as it were, more of him. And more of it is conditioned 
                through the commercial realities of his media persona and means 
                of making money. <em>Newsweek</em> knows it has three key audiences 
                for its coverage of him&#8212;gay men, straight women, and sports 
                fans of whatever orientation. That makes more money than just 
                appealing to the old sports fan, supposedly straight and drawn 
                purely by athletic performance, not by looks (but who knows about 
                that?). </p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Is there sometimes a pretty tricky &quot;eroticizing 
                the oppressor &quot; stuff going on here. All right, I'll just 
                speak for myself here. I was a bit appalled with myself recently 
                when I clipped out the photo of the Croatian tennis star Goran 
                Ivanisevic who had snarled his anti-gay slurs after winning Wimbledon 
                and then proceeded to head back to Croatia and strip down to his 
                bikini briefs in public. Such a hot homophobe! He's still on my 
                refrigerator! Is sports the last refuge of un-politically correct 
                erotics?</em> <br>
                <strong>A:</strong> Goran Ivanisevic is a very troubling character 
                for many of us. Sports are dominated by conservatives&#8212;every 
                golfer on the PGA tour is a registered R-word voter. Tennis players, 
                especially women, leave school well before they have learnt the 
                basics of social history. Most pro athletes subscribe to a notion 
                of natural ability added to hard work producing their success, 
                and extrapolate from that to other activities. They're not prone 
                to looking at inequality, oppression, etc unless it directly derives 
                from their own childhoods&#8212;and even then, they often understand 
                their success as the result of a merit-based system. Plus, despite 
                all the advances made to appeal to queers, pro sports is still 
                resolutely homophobic. Lennox Lewis and Hasim Rahman had a brawl 
                at an ESPN restaurant in August when they met to promote their 
                upcoming heavyweight boxing world title bout. This followed Rahman 
                referring to Lewis as 'gay' because the latter had used the courts 
                to initiate their contest. Weird to think of the law as a safe 
                house for queers! But this tension, this dynamic, this need to 
                define masculinity as 'not-gay' remains very very powerful indeed. 
                That said, Lewis and Rahman are revealing our cultural tensions 
                in a brutal way, living out the contradictions (including the 
                suspicion that part of this was a publicity stunt). Homophobia 
                is everywhere. Queers grow up with it all around, including, many 
                say, within themselves. It's a tough negotiation. There is a side 
                to sexual fantasy, as we all know, that is bad bad bad. Power 
                is hot. Sanitised sex is not. We often dream about and get off 
                on things we don't approve of or wish to do. And sometimes we 
                cross the boundary! </p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> Sportsex<em> beautifully explores the complicated 
                gender-bending that goes on in sports: the butt-slapping, wild 
                hugs, exaggerated almost drag-like behavior for the men and the 
                critique sometime hurled at women athletes for &quot;playing like 
                a man?&quot; What kind of genders are being &quot;performed&quot; 
                by these behaviors?</em> <br>
                <strong>A:</strong> These are means, I believe, of extending joy 
                beyond the bureaucratic norms of everyday life. They reference 
                a pre-adult, pre-adolescent moment, when touching intimately has 
                not been defined and theorized as transgressive. They represent 
                a wordless play of difference. Folks who would be uncomfortable 
                touching another man in any other context reach out to do so unfailingly 
                and joyously at play. When they do that, they open up our repertoire 
                of relating. </p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Our experience of sports is inevitable 
                very personal and embodied. You bring some really lovely and honest 
                personal narratives of your own experience with sports as you 
                grew up. What did you discover about your own relationship to 
                the subject as you wrote the book?</em> <br>
                <strong>A:</strong> First of all, the book came out just after 
                another one I did on globalization and sport. In each case, I'd 
                been working on the topic for thirteen years. So I discovered 
                relief and completion (a bit post-orgasmic!). On the topic itself, 
                I guess I confirmed that my own response to <em>Sportsex</em> 
                is highly ambivalent. I loath the disciplinary sides to sports, 
                the moralistic attitudes, and the history of sexism, racism, homophobia, 
                and nationalistic chauvinism. But I love the beauty and power. 
                And I think that there are some progressive sides to capitalism, 
                when it turns its eager eye on the body. For centuries, there 
                has been an over-valuation of the gaze of straight men at women, 
                as registered everywhere in our culture. Now, advertisers have 
                discovered a different gaze and they like how it looks. We can't 
                be sure what the outcome will be, but sports are changed forever.</td>
