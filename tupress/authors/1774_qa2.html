            <p><strong>Marc Stein talks about his view of Philadelphia's gay and 
              lesbian history.</strong>
            <p>By J. Cooper Robb for the <a href="http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/view.php?id=8215" target="new"><em>Philadelphia 
              Weekly</em></a>, 6 October 2004</p></td>

          <td colspan="2"><p>Marc Stein, a professor of history at Toronto's York 
              University and a former activist with ACT-UP and Queer Nation, is 
              in town this week to read from his book <em>City of Sisterly and 
              Brotherly Loves: Lesbian and Gay Philadelphia, 1945-1972</em>, now 
              out in paperback from Temple University Press.
            <p><strong>Q: </strong><em>Your book is scrupulously researched. How 
              many docu-ments did you use and how many people did you speak with?</em><br>
              <strong>A: </strong>&quot;I interviewed 45 people. I probably looked 
              at thousands of both published and unpublished documents. That was 
              really the painstaking part. But I didn't want the book to be based 
              just on people's memories.&quot;</p>
            <p><strong>Q: </strong><em>Some of the articles you cited were shocking, 
              such as when </em>Philadelphia<em> magazine used the term &quot;faggoty 
              fags&quot; to describe the men at the city's first Gay Pride march 
              in 1972.</em><br>
              <strong>A: </strong>&quot;I think what Philadelphia's magazines 
              and newspapers wrote was pretty typical of the coverage nationwide. 
              But some of <em>The Philadelphia Tribune</em>'s coverage of early 
              gay civil rights activism was somewhat sympathetic, which was unique 
              for a large black city newspaper.&quot;</p>
            <p><strong>Q: </strong><em>You were a member of both ACT-UP and Queer 
              Nation. Could you talk a little about the early days of gay activism?</em><br>
              <strong>A: </strong>&quot;In Philadelphia it really started in 1960 
              with mimeographed newsletters, and then Drum magazine was launched 
              in '64. Most gay magazines before the 1950s tended to be very respectable 
              text-heavy publications. Drum magazine for the first time brought 
              together hard-hitting news of interest to gays and lesbians--and 
              sexual imagery. It was the widest- circulating gay-movement magazine 
              in the country.&quot;</p>
            <p><strong>Q: </strong><em>You have a section on Rizzo's Raiders, 
              particularly the raid on the Humoresque coffee shop. What do you 
              think Frank Rizzo's impact was on the gay community?</em><br>
              <strong>A: </strong>&quot;I think it was a mixed record. On the 
              one hand, police repression was extraordinary. There are accounts 
              in the book of violence committed by the police under Rizzo's watch 
              against gay men and lesbians, including the raid you mentioned and 
              the crackdown on the Halloween-night tradition when drag queens 
              paraded in and out of bars. So there are definitely repressive elements. 
              But at the same time, because Rizzo had a relationship with organized 
              crime and because both the police and organized crime could profit 
              from the existence of vice bars, a vice district and gay bars, there 
              was also a certain amount of ghettoized tolerance, and that was 
              why there was quite a lively gay scene centered around 13th and 
              Locust. As long as it didn't erupt too much into the streets and 
              as long as you stayed in the neighborhood, there was a certain amount 
              of tolerance for the gay scene.&quot;</p>
            <p><strong>Q: </strong><em>So is it fair to say that if gays and lesbians 
              stuck to the Gayborhood, the police left them alone?</em><br>
              <strong>A: </strong>&quot;I'm not sure about that. Most everyone 
              I talked to had been arrested or knew someone who'd been arrested. 
              So what does it mean when you're arrested one out of the 10 times 
              you go out? It means most of the time you're fine, but one out of 
              10 is pretty bad if you're going out most weekends.&quot;</p>
            <p><strong>Q: </strong><em>Gay and lesbian relationships are featured 
              prominently in the book. How did these relationships compare with 
              straight relationships at the time?</em><br>
              <strong>A: </strong>&quot;At the outset of my project I was hoping 
              the relationships between gay men and lesbians historically would 
              be very different than what we find among the straight community. 
              I think in the end what I found is that relationships between lesbians 
              and gay men are just as bad as the relationships between straight 
              women and men. There was instance after instance of sexism among 
              gay men, and certainly many instances of segregation.&quot;</p>
            <p><strong>Q: </strong><em>Did Philadelphia gay and lesbian African-Americans 
              play a larger role in the queer community than they did in other 
              cities?</em><br>
              <strong>A: </strong>&quot;I think they did. Compared to New York 
              and San Francisco, Philadelphia has a much larger percentage of 
              African-Americans. Just from the demographics there was bound to 
              be a greater level of black queer activity. There's evidence of 
              that in the significant number of bars that cater to black men or 
              a multiracial clientele, as well as the black Halloween drag-queen 
              parade that happened on South Street. Particularly after Stonewall, 
              Latinos, Asians and African-Americans began to play a leading role 
              in the homophile movement.&quot; </p>
