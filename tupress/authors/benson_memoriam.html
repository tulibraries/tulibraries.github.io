          <td><p>Susan Porter Benson died at home in Manchester, Connecticut, 
              on June 20, 2005. She had taught at Bristol Community College (1968-1986), 
              the University of Warwick, United Kingdom (1984), the University 
              of Missouri-Columbia (1986-1993), Yale University (1998), and the 
              University of Connecticut (1993-2005). Nancy Hewitt has described 
              Porter Benson as "one of those rare individuals who truly 
              believes in a community of scholars, and who knows that such a community 
              can only be created and sustained by hard work and a generous spirit." 
              Porter Benson devoted over three decades to the crafting of community, 
              attracting countless labor advocates, feminists, and history enthusiasts 
              with her warmth, wit, and wisdom.
            <p>The daughter of storekeepers Alvin and Lorraine Porter, Susan Porter 
              Benson was born in Washington, Pennsylvania, on July 26, 1943. She 
              graduated from Simmons College in 1964, and earned a Master's 
              degree from Brown University in 1968. She began teaching at Bristol 
              Community College that same year. She took leave to do labor education 
              for the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Worker's Union, funded 
              by a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. Porter 
              Benson earned a PhD in History from Boston University in 1983. She 
              helped found a cooperative household on Hope Street in Providence, 
              Rhode Island, a haven for aspiring historians.</p>
            <p>Porter Benson contributed a monograph of monumental importance 
              to the history of labor and women in the United States. <em>Counter 
              Cultures: Saleswomen, Managers, and Customers in American Department 
              Stores</em> (1986) pioneered the historical analysis of service 
              industry labor, and the book remains a model for single-occupation 
              studies. Demonstrating the value of scholarly sharing, Porter Benson 
              collaborated with Barbara Melosh to craft "work culture" into an 
              effective conceptual category for women's labor history. The analytical 
              tool revised understandings of occupational expertise, allowing 
              Porter Benson to examine relations in the burgeoning service sector 
              that Marxist analysis had heretofore limited to encounters between 
              male craft skill and management strategies on the factory floor.</p>
            <p>Her longstanding engagement with consumer culture animates the 
              forthcoming <em>Household Accounts: Working-Class Family Economies 
              in the Interwar USA</em>. The book traces the continuity of irregular 
              and inadequate income that circumscribed working-class spending 
              in both the 1920s and the 1930s, challenging standard characterizations 
              of the 1920s as the "Age of Mass Consumption."</p>
            <p>As co-editor of a special issue of <em>Radical History Review</em>, 
              Porter Benson generated interest in the study of public history. 
              The influential issue led to her co-editing, along with Stephen 
              Brier and Roy Rosenzweig, of <a href="../titles/406_reg.html"><em>Presenting 
              the Past: Essays on History and the Public</em></a> (1986). This 
              collection, in turn, inspired "<a href="../critical.html">Critical 
              Perspectives on the Past</a>," the popular Temple University Press 
              book series. "Sue has been an extraordinarily generous mentor to 
              dozens of scholars in myriad settings&#8212;as a journal editor, 
              as a program committee member, or a book series editor," offered 
              Rosenzweig. "And, if we could bring these people together, they 
              would collectively and unanimously attest to Sue's generosity and 
              what can only be called 'wisdom.'"</p>
            <p>Porter Benson had no equal as a mentor to undergraduate and graduate 
              students. She lived a commitment to a democratized historical community. 
              She devoted special attention to the professional development of 
              non-traditional students, whether older students, students of color, 
              or those from working class backgrounds. Her guidance allowed a 
              diverse group of students to situate race, sexuality, gender, and 
              class at the center of the historical experience, transforming our 
              collective understanding of the past. Her students comprise part 
              of the large but loving community who mourn her passing. She is 
              survived by her husband, Edward Benson, her daughter, Katherine 
              Musler, and her mother, Loraine Porter.</p>
