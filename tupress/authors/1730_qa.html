          <td colspan="2" valign="top"> <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>What thought 
              or thoughts about Juvenile Justice motivated you to write this book?</em> 
              <br>
              <strong>A:</strong> The idea: &quot;Would you want to be forever 
              defined by what you did at 14?&quot; 
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>How did you get involved in the issue of 
              Juvenile Justice?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> As a teenager growing up in Manhattan's Little 
              Italy in the 1950s, I saw how easily a careless choice could draw 
              one into a situation that carried &quot;the appearance of a culpability 
              not necessarily justified by the true facts.&quot; When the legendary 
              District Attorney Frank Hogan gave me an opportunity to work in 
              his office, his policy towards young offenders was especially significant 
              to me. He believed that courts and prosecutors had a special obligation 
              to make sure that young people were treated fairly and effectively, 
              recognizing that young offenders were malleable and could be positively 
              influenced. As a judge I was able to weave that sensitivity into 
              my work, but I soon realized the limitations of laws that inhibited 
              a constructive response to juvenile offending. This book has grown 
              out of those experiences.</p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Why did you write this book?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> I wrote this book in an effort to make a difference 
              in the way children are treated in our courts. I believe the book 
              illustrates the corrosive impact of our current national policy 
              of trying children as adults. It is written from the perspective 
              of a judge&#8212;who for 25 years has served in New York City's 
              criminal courts&#8212;grappling with the issues presented by troubled 
              children and children in trouble with the law. My goal was to describe 
              a humane and constructive policy of juvenile justice that would 
              form the basis for a model of justice for minors&#8212;a model based 
              on the true nature of adolescence and the realities faced by youth 
              in modern society.</p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>How would you improve the system?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> I do not ignore the impact of juvenile crime 
              on its victims. On the contrary, <em>Judging Children as Children</em> 
              offers a proposal in the form of a model of juvenile justice that 
              is likely to prevent further criminal behavior and give young offenders 
              an opportunity to lead fulfilling lives. </p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>What is wrong with our current national 
              policy of trying children as adults?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> Trying children as adults instead of as children 
              is not just. The policies underlying these laws ignore common sense, 
              ancient conceptions of childhood, as well as what &quot;science 
              knows about adolescents and their diminished abilities to act responsibly 
              and rationally and their greater capacity to be rehabilitated.&quot; 
              Thus, these laws are at odds with human nature and sound social 
              and economic policy.</p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>You mention in the book that &quot;when 
              we try children in adult courts, we do so as a result of flawed 
              reasoning, penalizing them for not exercising that degree of judgment 
              that we would expect of adults.&quot; Why do you think children 
              should be held up to a different standard of responsibility?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> Common sense tells us that children are developmentally 
              different from adults. Anyone who has had the responsibility of 
              raising teenagers or remembers what is was like to be an adolescent 
              recognizes, for example, the powerful pull of peer pressure, yet 
              we essentially penalize adolescents for not resisting negative peer 
              pressure through the application of standards of culpability that 
              we would expect to apply to adults. That is not to say that a 14-year-old 
              cannot know or appreciate right from wrong, but how can we hold 
              adolescents accountable as adults in adult courts for not exercising 
              a level of maturity that they are not physically, emotionally, or 
              intellectually expected to possess? However, laws that require such 
              an approach are presently the most commonly proposed method for 
              addressing juvenile crime in America. </p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>You must have seen some pretty troubled 
              children in your courtroom. How do you keep a fair outlook with 
              each case?</em> <br>
              <strong>A:</strong> I approach each child and his or her case with 
              the recognition that they pose a challenge that I try to meet, if 
              possible, with the tools and programs available to me. Children 
              are generally more malleable than adults and therefore less wedded 
              to their misbehavior and more susceptible to positive influence. 
              Of course, not every child can be spared imprisonment. Some must, 
              for the immediate safety of society, be incarcerated, but each child 
              deserves an individualized assessment of their culpability and capacity 
              to conform their behavior to society's standards </p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>How do you arrive at a specific sentence?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> Factors that must be considered in deciding 
              on a sentence for juvenile offenders include respect for the suffering 
              of the victim and the victim's family, maintenance of public confidence 
              in the rule of law, and recognition of the State's responsibility 
              to protect children and insure their development. Determining an 
              appropriate sentence requires reflection on the facts of the case, 
              the individualized circumstances of an offender, and the recommendations 
              of prosecution and defense counsel. For example, with respect to 
              an individual youth, I consider the extent of the youth's involvement 
              in the underlying crime, whether he or she engaged in personal violence 
              to achieve their purpose, the capacity of the youth to benefit from 
              counseling offered by alternative-to-incarceration programs, the 
              youth's prior delinquency record, if any, and his or her school 
              performance. I also make an effort to speak to each child personally. 
              With such reflection, the outlines of a sentence usually crystallize 
              from my accumulated experience in dealing with cases of this nature. 
            </p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>In Chapter 5 you list characteristics of 
              children who are involved in crime. For example: single parent families, 
              neglect/abuse, addiction, educational problems, etc. Do you think 
              that there are ways to solve these problems first, and thereby reduce 
              the number of offenders? Can you foresee any chance of reducing 
              the number of children at risk?</em> <br>
              <strong>A:</strong> I began Chapter 1 of the book with the story 
              of Loretta&#8212;a 14-year-old girl who was charged as an accomplice 
              in a robbery and prosecuted as an adult&#8212;to illustrate the 
              dimension of the problems young offenders present. The challenge 
              posed by children like Loretta requires a rejuvenation of spirit, 
              a concrete display of opportunity, and an absolute right to the 
              best education available, so that these [disadvantaged] children 
              will be prepared to embrace opportunity when it is presented. We 
              try to meet this challenge in the Youth Part, but we cannot directly 
              confront the underlying issues and the social conditions that lead 
              to juvenile crime. These issues must be addressed through a comprehensive 
              youth policy that recognizes that children born into neighborhoods 
              where public services and educational institutions are weakest need 
              our attention and support. Most juvenile offenders come from our 
              poorest neighborhoods. At many public schools, more than half of 
              our disadvantaged students drop out before they reach 12th grade. 
              One way of reducing the number of children at risk is to increase 
              our commitment to improving the educational institutions in these 
              neighborhoods. </p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>What strategies do you employ to encourage 
              the children you see to take control and better their lives?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> In the Youth Part, we rely on the device of 
              a &quot;deferred sentence&quot; to give certain youths a chance 
              to earn probation and have their records sealed by successfully 
              completing an alternative-to-incarceration program. It suffices 
              to say that we have structured the Youth Part process as a system 
              of reward and punishment in the sense of providing encouragement 
              and support when appropriate, as well as timely instilling discipline 
              and exacting a cost for misbehavior when necessary.<br>
