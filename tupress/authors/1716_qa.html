            <p><strong> Bob Bloss' latest book honors baseball 'Rookies of the Year'</strong>
            <p>By M. English for <i><a href="http://www.timesherald.com/site/printerFriendly.cfm?brd=1672&dept_id=33380&newsid=14614916" target="new">The

          <td colspan="2"><p> First, there was Jackie Robinson. That was 1947. 
              Then, there were luminaries like Willie Mays, Cal Ripken Jr. and 
              Derek Jeter. But whether or not their names became synonymous with 
              America's Pastime, baseball's Rookies of the Year are special. 
            <p>"This prestigious award is unique because a player has only one 
              opportunity to win it," observes Plymouth Meeting author Bob Bloss 
              in "Rookies of the Year," just published by Temple University Press. 
              "Cy Young awards, Manager of the Year, and MVP honors can be achieved 
              multiple times, as can individual 'best' years in all offensive 
              and defensive categories." 
            <p>Adds Bloss as he prepares for a book-signing session at Barnes 
              & Noble's Metroplex store in Plymouth Meeting Saturday, "Rookie 
              of the Year is unlike any other statistical category because it's 
              one and done. I think that's a large part of the reason it is such 
              an honor. It's interesting, too, when you realize how many of the 
              big names - people like Mickey Mantle, Hank Aaron, Sandy Koufax, 
              Mike Schmidt - were not Rookies of the Year." 
            <p>Bloss's signing engagement follows guest spots on radio stations 
              around the country - most recently for Radio KCCA in California 
              and Fred Wallin's nationall syndicated Sports Biz program. A May 
              17 appearance at the Trover book store in Washington, D.C., included 
              a reception sponsored by the D.C. Baseball Association. 
            <p>A former <em>Times Herald</em> sports writer and seasoned freelance 
              journalist, Bloss made the literary rounds with his first book&#8212;"Baseball 
              Managers: Stats, Stories, and Strategies"&#8212;also published by 
              Temple University Press, in 1999. 
            <p>He interviewed several of his "Rookies of the Year" sources during 
              games in Philadelphia, New York and Baltimore and tracked down others 
              during spring training. All told, he talked to 40 of the 116 players 
              profiled and nearly as many coaches, managers and other sources 
              "closely associated" with his subjects. 
            <p>Bloss remembers his conversation with Frank Robinson of the Cincinnati 
              Reds, 1956 National League Rookie of the Year, as one of his favorites. 
              He points to the following comments made by Robinson as the two 
              chatted in the manager's office at the former Veterans Stadium: 
              "After the season there was no big deal. The league phoned to say 
              I was Rookie of the Year. That was it. No citation or anything. 
              But there was a fan club in Cincinnati&#8212;some people who got 
              to know me that summer. They chipped in, bought a trophy with all 
              the statistics and so forth, and presented it to me at an informal 
              neighborhood get-together. I still cherish that trophy. It's the 
              only one I got that signifies Rookie of the Year." 
            <p>Recalls Bloss, "I'd been told beforehand that Frank Robinson was 
              something of a curmudgeon, but he couldn't have been nicer. I found, 
              though, that virtually everybody I talked to was pleased to reminisce 
              about their first year, whether it was one year ago or 45 years 
              ago. "For example, Mark McGwire said, 'All anybody wants to talk 
              about is...home runs and...the long ball. Thanks for letting me 
              talk about something else.' "
            <p> In addition to his consideration of each Rookie of the Year, Bloss 
              addresses trends within teams. For instance: 
            <p>"The Los Angeles Dodgers had an unprecedented five Rookies of the 
              Year in a row, while the Pittsburgh Pirates had none until last 
              year. 
            <p>"Of the 29 pitchers who earned Rookies of the Year laurels, only 
              one was a 20-game winner in his Rookie season. 
            <p>"Only two teams&#8212; the expansion Arizona and Tampa Bay clubs&#8212;have 
              failed to produce a Rookie of the Year." 
            <p>Bloss' personal passion for sports began when he was a kid playing 
              pick-up ball with neighborhood pals in Erie and attending high school 
              football and basketball games with his father. Apparently, he had 
              no illusions about his own chances for Rookie of the Year status. 
              "(I am) a former second-string high school outfielder who could 
              hit a curve ball only when (I) knew it was coming...and, then, not 
              very far," he quips.
            <p> At Temple University, Bloss did announcing for campus radio, served 
              as yearbook sports editor and earned a communications degree in 
              1957. He went on to announcer jobs for radio stations in Erie and 
              Wilmington, Del., and WHYY-TV/FM in Philadelphia. He also did sports 
              play-by-play for WNPV, WNAR, WIFI and WXTU. 
            <p>Following his stint at <em>The Times Herald</em>, Bloss spent 24 
              years as national merchandising manager and advertiser special events 
              director for <em>TV Guide Magazine</em>. He specializes in articles 
              related to baseball&#8212;including 10 years' worth of columns for 
              the <em>Phillies Report</em> and feature stories for <em>Temple 
              Review</em>&#8212;but is also a regular feature contributor to <em>Rough 
              Notes Magazine</em>, a national insurance monthly. Bloss belongs 
              to the Philadelphia Sports Writers Association, the Society for 
              American Baseball Research, the Philadelphia Athletics Historical 
              Society and the Montgomery County Coaches Hall of Fame advisory 
              board. He and wife Floriana have two daughters and two grandchildren. 
            <p><em>Rookies of the Year</em>, illustrated with some 50 player photos 
              and 119 tables, retails for $19.95 and is also available online 
              at amazon.com.</td>
