          <td colspan="2" valign="top"> <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Your book is 
              called </em>Why Our Drug Laws Have Failed<em>. What characterizes 
              the failure of our drug laws?</em> <br>
                <strong>A:</strong> Our policy of Drug Prohibition has failed 
                from every standpoint imaginable: unnecessary prison growth, increased 
                taxes, increased crime and corruption here and abroad, loss of 
                civil liberties, decreased health, diversion of resources that 
                are needed to address other problems in society. I could go on 
                and on&#8230; 
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>If that is the case, why do we continue 
                with a policy that so many prople agree has failed? </em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> There are numbers of practical reasons: We 
                are fighting decades of rhetoric which incorrectly assumes that 
                the answer for drug use and abuse is prison. And scores of politicians 
                get elected and re-elected each year by posturing about the need 
                to get &quot;tougher&quot; on drugs. Another big reason for the 
                perpetuation of this failed policy is money- both legal and illegal. 
                The profit motive to sell small amounts of drugs for large amounts 
                of money simply overwhelms all efforts to restrict those sales. 
                In addition, our policy is fueled by the &quot;runaway freight 
                train&quot; of federal money-every federal agency we have is addicted 
                to its drug war funding, and they do not want to give it up. </p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>You are taking a pretty controversial 
                position for a Superior Court Judge. Do many other judges feel 
                the same way you do about this? </em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> Yes. But, like with most public officials, 
                there is a difference in what they say privately as opposed to 
                what they will say in public. However, my book quotes comments 
                from more than forty judges nationwide about their experiences 
                and recommendations for change, and many of these judges are speaking 
                publicly about this issue for the first time. </p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Considering your position, then, can 
                you offer any optimism? </em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> I agree that people are discouraged under 
                our present policy. But I bring good news: there is hope. We have 
                viable options, and they are working in numbers of places around 
                the world. My book gets very specific about those options. </p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>But these drugs are dangerous. Shouldn't 
                dangerous things be illegal?</em> <br>
                <strong>A:</strong> Many things in our society are dangerous, 
                but making them illegal is not the answer. Does anyone really 
                believe that making tobacco illegal would reduce the harm it causes? 
                What about glue, gasoline, chain saws and high cholesterol foods? 
                Further, if you think about it, we have at least some controls 
                with regard to the sales and use of alcohol and tobacco, because 
                they are regulated by the government. We have no controls at all 
                with these illicit substances, because they are controlled by 
                the mob. </p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>But doesn't a change in policy send the 
                wrong message to our children? </em><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> I answer that by asking you what you think 
                is the right message? We have more people in prison in our country 
                than anywhere else in the world. People, including many children, 
                have died from drug overdoses because of unknown strength and 
                purity of these substances, and because their &quot;friends&quot; 
                did not seek prompt medical attention for them fearing&#8212;legitimately&#8212;that 
                they would get into legal trouble if they came forward. And, far 
                from protecting our children, our present policy is actually recruiting 
                them to a lifestyle of drug usage and drug selling. </p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>That sounds like you are advocating drug 
                use. Are you?</em> <br>
                <strong>A:</strong> I hate these drugs so much that I want to 
                change our policy so that we can reduce drug usage and the other 
                harms these dangerous drugs are causing. These drugs could not 
                be made more available than they are under our present system-we 
                can't even keep them out of our prisons, much less off our streets. 
                But change will come as soon as people realize one simple truth: 
                Just because we discuss drug policy, or just because we realize 
                we have options to it, or just because we choose to employ one 
                or more of those options does not mean that we condone drug use 
                or abuse. As soon as people understand that simple fact, we will 
                move forward to a more effective policy, because what we are doing 
                now cannot stand the light of day.</td>
