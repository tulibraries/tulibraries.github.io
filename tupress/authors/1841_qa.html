            <p><strong>Eric Burns describes the buzz he created writing about 
              the social history of tobacco in <em>The Smoke of the Gods</em></strong></td>
        </tr>
		<tr>
          <td colspan="2" valign="top"> <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>You did a book 
              on alcohol, now one on tobacco. Why did you choose these topics 
              to write &quot;social histories&quot;? </em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> Because the topics are inherently fascinating 
              in what they reveal about human nature, about the extent to which 
              people will go to seek pleasure&#8212;even when that pleasure is 
              almost certain to bring eventual pain. And about the extent to which 
              other people will go to restrict the pleasures of their mates.
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> The Smoke of the Gods<em> opens with the quote, 
              &quot;Imagine yourself a Maya.&quot; How do you get into the mindset 
              of the historical figures you write about? </em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> I did not get into the mind of the Mayas. I 
              simply read enough about them to understand their rituals and the 
              reasons for them.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Q:</strong> <em>You describe the Mayas blowing smoke up 
              their&#8230;&#8212;let me rephrase this question&#8212;gave each 
              other &quot;smoke enemas.&quot; In retrospect, they probably did 
              more harm than good. Did you come across any interesting facts to 
              show how the Mayas benefited or suffered as a result of their smoking 
              habits?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> There is no way to know, at this late date, 
              the extent to which the Mayas might have suffered physically as 
              a result of their tobacco consumption. That they benefited spiritually, 
              or believed they did, is unarguable.</p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>In </em>The Spirits of America<em>, alcoholic 
              beverages were shown to be an important part of the electoral process 
              in the colonial era. Tobacco, it seems from what you write in </em>The 
              Smoke of the Gods<em>, was a critical component of the Jamestown 
              settler's economy. What made the leaf such an important form of 
              business? </em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> Tobacco was the first New World product that 
              turned a profit; i.e., that proved a desirable export. Had the leaf 
              not been successfully cultivated when it was, it is likely that 
              the British would have given up on Jamestown. It is possible that 
              they would have given up, at least for a time, on the notion of 
              colonizing that entire part of the New World. If this had happened, 
              the United States would have been a far different country today, 
              in ways no one could imagine.</p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>One of the &quot;characters&quot; from 
              </em>The Spirits of America<em>&#8212;Benjamin Rush&#8212;returns 
              in </em>The Smoke of the Gods<em>. Did you find much crossover in 
              writing these books? Were alcohol and tobacco often linked together 
              back in the Colonial era as they are now?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> Only by a few reformers for one simple and obvious 
              reason. The harmful effects of too much imbibing were apparent immediately. 
              The harmful effects of too much smoking took a long time to manifest 
              themselves. It is for this reason that tobacco reformers were not 
              successful until the 20th century, when scientific and medical research 
              was finally available to back them up.</p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Once again, you have many interesting historical 
              figures in your book. What can you say about Lucy Page Gaston, whom 
              you dub &quot;The Carrie Nation of Tobacco&quot;? </em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> Lucy Page Gaston grabbed my attention and refuse 
              to let go. She is one of the most compelling, if least known, figures 
              in all of American history: a woman so committed to her anti-smoking 
              views that she had no life outside of the movement and, eventually, 
              no life within it. Her passion became so overwhelming that even 
              her allies became alienated and turned into enemies.</p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>There is much discussion about anti-smoking 
              laws throughout history in the book, and this debate continues today. 
              Why do you think these debates have gone on for so long?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> Because they call into stark contrast two fundamental 
              tenets of American thought: On the one hand, we believe in individual 
              freedom. On the other, we believe in personal health and enrichment. 
              The conflict between the two is inherent in tobacco.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Q:</strong> <em>What did you find in your research for The 
              Smoke of the Gods that amused you?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> The bizarre medical beliefs about tobacco in 
              the early days, when it was thought to be a cure for virtually all 
              diseases. And the even more bizarre ways in which it was administered, 
              including vaginally, to treat hysteria. Also amusing, although it 
              perhaps fits under the heading of black humor more than conventional 
              amusement, are the attempts made by the tobacco companies in the 
              20th century to continue to sell their products as medical evidence 
              against those products became ever more conclusive. I was amused 
              as well by the company that developed a filter so effective that 
              virtually none of the taste of the tobacco got through, and so it 
              was forced to come up with an &quot;improved&quot; filter that was 
              more like a sieve, so that people could taste the tobacco and more 
              effectively rot their lungs.</p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Your chapter on the pulse of the nation 
              leading up to the Surgeon General's warning about the links between 
              smoking and cancer are marvelous. What do you remember about this 
              announcement? </em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> That it was the end of the argument about the 
              health consequences of tobacco. From that point on, the tobacco 
              industry could no longer pretend that cigarettes didn't kill. It 
              had to develop other strategies, such as diversification, to survive.</p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>I am sure writing this book has made you 
              never want to take up smoking. Do you think reading it will prompt 
              anyone who does smoke quit?</em><br>
              <strong>A:</strong> Perhaps, but it seems to me unlikely. Given 
              all that's known about the harmful effects of tobacco in the year 
              2006, anyone who still indulges is unlikely to undergo a change 
              in behavior because of a mere book. </p></td>
