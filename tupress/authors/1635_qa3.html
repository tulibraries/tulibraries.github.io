            <p><strong>Making History Her Story, Too</strong>

		<tr>
          <td colspan="2" valign="top"> <p>As a historian, Gerda Lerner has 
                learned to take the long view. It is a perspective that applies 
                equally to her work and her life. At 82, Dr. Lerner is considered 
                a godmother of women's history. Yet she certainly did not arrive 
                on the scene as a full-blown feminist historian. As she recently 
                set her table for lunch in her small brown house surrounded by 
                trees here, she recalled years of contradictory realities: of 
                being a housewife and a scholar, a victim of anti-Semitism and 
                a powerful women's rights advocate, at times prosperous and at 
                times poor. 
              <p>&quot;I wanted to show people that whatever contributions I could 
                make as a historian and a theoretician of women's history and 
                women's studies came out of my practical life experiences,&quot; 
                Dr. Lerner said, tucking into a salad of sliced eggs and anchovies. 
                &quot;When you get older, you have a desire to look at your whole 
                life, not just the end result and not just a particular point.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>Dr. Lerner, who is a professor of history emerita at the University 
                of Wisconsin at Madison, has just published her memoir,<em> Fireweed: 
                A Political Autobiography</em> (Temple University Press). The 
                title comes from the fireweed plant, which grows on disturbed 
                soil by roadsides and in fire clearings in the forest&#8212;a 
                flowering survivor, like Dr. Lerner. It is a &quot;political autobiography,&quot; 
                she explained, because she views her personal and her political 
                selves as inseparable. </p>
              <p><em>Fireweed</em> begins in the 1920's in Vienna, where Dr. Lerner 
                was born Gerda Kronstein, the first child of Ilona and Robert 
                Kronstein, an affluent Jewish couple. Her father was a pharmacist, 
                her mother a frustrated artist. The memoir details Dr. Lerner's 
                evolution as a political activist as she faced the Nazis in Vienna 
                and joined the Communist Party in the United States, and it examines 
                her personal relationships that both bloomed and withered against 
                the backdrop of sweeping historical events. </p>
              <p>Dr. Lerner writes at length about her difficult relationship 
                with her mother, who survived a concentration camp but died in 
                Europe far from her estranged husband and Gerda, her elder daughter. 
                Dr. Lerner, arriving in the United States emaciated and emotionally 
                drained after fleeing the Nazis, made a sad first marriage so 
                she could stay in this country. </p>
              <p>A happy second marriage to the filmmaker Carl Lerner produced 
                a son and a daughter and a quest to integrate the couple's political 
                activities with family life in New York City. With luck, they 
                survived the McCarthy era (she and her husband later severed their 
                Communist Party ties), and on the cusp of the 1960's, Gerda Lerner 
                was a housewife, writing a novel and other fiction and joining 
                causes, from improving schools to protesting nuclear weapons. 
                This memoir, which has received a bouquet of laudatory reviews, 
                ends in 1958, just as Dr. Lerner was beginning her life as a historian. 
                (Her creative writing, though published, never brought her fame.) 
              </p>
              <p>The short version of the post-<em>Fireweed</em> story is that 
                in 1958, when her children were well into their teens, Dr. Lerner 
                went back to school, initially to take a few college courses, 
                and by 1966 had a doctorate in history from Columbia University. 
                Her considerable reputation rests mostly on virtually creating 
                the field of women's history and then tirelessly agitating to 
                help her female colleagues win respect and find audiences for 
                their work. </p>
              <p>In 1963, at the New School for Social Research, now the New School 
                University, Dr. Lerner taught what is believed to be the first 
                postwar college course in women's history. In 1972, as a history 
                professor at Sarah Lawrence College, she established the program 
                that became a model for graduate education in women's history. 
              </p>
              <p>Dr. Lerner now has 11 history books to her name. She was the 
                editor of the groundbreaking <em>Black Women in White America: 
                A Documentary History</em>, (Pantheon, 1972), one of the first 
                books to detail the contributions of black women.</p>
              <p>&quot;When it was published, it had enormous impact; it revealed 
                that there were the sources to write these kinds of histories,&quot; 
                said Alice Kessler-Harris, a professor of history at Columbia 
                University, whom Dr. Lerner convinced to study women's history 
                when they first met at Barnard College in 1969. </p>
              <p>In May Dr. Lerner became the first woman to receive the Bruce 
                Catton Prize for Lifetime Achievement in Historical Writing from 
                the Society of American Historians. As <em>Fireweed</em> shows, 
                the road there was unpaved. </p>
              <p>&quot;I enter graduate school, and they teach me all these great 
                names, all these famous names, and they teach me about a world 
                in which women don't exist,&quot; she said with obvious irritation. 
                &quot;And when I ask about it, one of their favorite sayings was 
                that unfortunately, most women were illiterate.&quot; She shook 
                her head. </p>
              <p>&quot;I came out of an experience where I had organized at the 
                grass-roots level, and I knew what these women could do and did 
                do,&quot; she said. &quot;I was able to bring that knowledge in 
                the push for women's history.&quot;</p>
              <p>Dr. Lerner peers out intently from big glasses and has a strong, 
                German-accented voice that demands an ear. </p>
              <p>Her home is immaculate, a place of Danish Modern furniture, a 
                fluffy golden carpet, her mother's abstract art on the walls. 
                She has lived alone since her husband died in 1973. Photographs 
                of her four grandchildren dot the refrigerator.</p>
              <p>A woman known for her impatience and no-nonsense manner, Dr. 
                Lerner said she was disdainful of memoir writing as a catharsis 
                rather than as an attempt to convey a larger meaning. She had 
                worked out her feelings toward everything she wrote about, she 
                said, but parts of <em>Fireweed</em> were painful to remember 
                and record. The kaleidoscope of images from its pages includes 
                a Gerda who celebrated her 18th birthday in a Viennese jail cell 
                with two gentile girls, her rations cut in half because she was 
                a Jew. </p>
              <p>&quot;I have given some readings of this chapter, and it still 
                upsets me very much,&quot; she said, her eyes half closing. She 
                and her mother were jailed by the Nazis in an attempt to make 
                them reveal the location of her father, who had temporarily fled 
                Vienna. </p>

              <p>&quot;I feel like a lot of people who have survived the Holocaust,&quot; 
                she continued. &quot;The people my age, we are the last generation 
                of eyewitnesses. Many of us have found it extremely painful to 
                think about this time and to speak about it even to our children 
                or loved ones. If we don't, then the eyewitness primary account 
                is lost, and the only people who will interpret this period are 
                people who don't have a clue. They weren't there.&quot; </p>
              <p>Her commitment to political struggle probably arose, she said, 
                in Vienna in 1934, when she sat in her family's darkened apartment 
                and heard the machine-gun staccato of fascists shooting up housing 
                projects even as the radio newscasts said all was quiet. &quot;I 
                said to myself, 'This I can't live with'; I think it started then. 
                I was 14 years old.&quot;</p>
              <p>It was never a leap to understand why other groups she studied, 
                like black women, felt like outsiders, she said. Or even why women 
                too often fail to understand one another.</p>
              <p>&quot;I stayed home until my youngest child was 16 years old,&quot; 
                she said. &quot;I was a full-time mother. I have always felt that 
                feminists have to understand more about that experience. Whenever 
                you want to make any change in the community, from getting a stoplight 
                at a school crossing to putting in a park, the people who make 
                the change are your stay-at-home housewives all over the country, 
                all over the world.&quot; </p>
              <p>After her work at Sarah Lawrence, Dr. Lerner began the University 
                of Wisconsin's graduate program in women's history as part of 
                its American history program. For a long time, it was among a 
                handful of places offering a doctorate in women's history. Now 
                there are hundreds of women's history courses taught at universities. 
              </p>
              <p>&quot;With the scholarship, the program-building and the writing, 
                any of those three things would have made her an important historian,&quot; 
                said Linda Gordon, a professor of history at New York University 
                who taught women's history at the University of Wisconsin in the 
                1980's. </p>
              <p>Dr. Lerner's body of work includes an ambitious two-volume study 
                titled <em>Women and History</em>, published by Oxford University 
                Press in 1986 and 1993. Volume I explored the creation of patriarchy 
                and Volume II the creation of feminist consciousness from the 
                Middle Ages to 1870. Volume I was particularly praised for its 
                range but criticized for the slimness of some of its evidence. 
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I don't think anyone would take on a topic now like she 
                did about the history of patriarchy,&quot; Dr. Gordon said. &quot;A 
                lot more research would have to be done, there would be fewer 
                generalizations.&quot; But as in writing a book like <em>Fireweed</em>, 
                Dr. Gordon said, Dr. Lerner showed an ambition that combined thorough 
                examination with unflinching honesty. </p>
              <p>When asked whether women's studies were still needed, Dr. Lerner 
                laughed. &quot;For 4,000 years, men have defined culture by looking 
                at the activities of other men,&quot; she said, putting on her 
                professorial voice. &quot;The minute we started questioning it, 
                the first question was, 'Well, when are you going to stop separating 
                yourself out and mainstream?'&quot;</p>
              <p>&quot;Give us another 4,000 years,&quot; she said, &quot;and 
                we'll talk about mainstreaming.&quot;</td>
