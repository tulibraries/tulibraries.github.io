        a Prison Uprising</a><br>
        </b>By Staughton Lynd
      <p> June 29, 2004
      <p> Dear Reader:
      <p> I have written this book with two concerns. The first is to do what 
        I can to save the lives of five men unjustly sentenced to death. The second 
        is to describe the most extraordinary experience of interracial solidarity 
        I have encountered since leaving the South in 1964. (Three of the &quot;Lucasville 
        Five&quot; are African Americans, and two are Caucasians who in 1993 were 
        members of the Aryan Brotherhood.) 
      <p> Among the more particular conclusions of the book are the following: 
      <ul>
        <li>1. The State of Ohio has a significant share of the responsibility 
          for the death of Officer Robert Vallandingham. <p>
        <li>2. None of the Lucasville Five were hands-on killers of Officer Vallandingham, 
          nor did they participate in the decision to kill him. There is overwhelming 
          evidence that the murder of Officer Vallandingham was planned and supervised 
          by the State's principal informant, Anthony Lavelle.<p>
        
        <li>3. In the absence of physical evidence, the Special Prosecutor and 
          the State Highway Patrol obtained convictions by threatening and cutting 
          deals with prisoners who stood to benefit when they turned State's evidence.<p>
        
        <li>4. The statements of fact by the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>State v. 
          Robb </em>and <em>State v. Sanders</em> are devoid of citation to the 
          record and riddled with factual errors.<p>
        
        <li>5. Ohio should follow the example of the State of New York when that 
          state came to recognize that its investigation and prosecution of the 
          Attica rebellion were flawed by prosecutorial misconduct: Ohio, like 
          New York, should declare a general amnesty for riot-related offenses.
</ul> 
      <p>I welcome the opportunity to debate and discuss the material<br>
        presented in <em>Lucasville</em>.
