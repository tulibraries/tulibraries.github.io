      <p><b><a href="../titles/x127_dis.html" target="_top">Take Out: Queer Writing From Asian Pacific America</a></b><br>
      Edited by Quong Bao and Hanya Yanagihara (Temple University Press, $22.95, trade paperback)
      <p>Reviewed by Harry Eugene Baldwin
	  <p>The richly varied stories, poems, and mini-plays in this new and very welcome anthology are so readable&#151even the slightest, most jejune of them&#151that one almost wants to be cast away on a desert island (one in the Pacific, naturally) to have the time to read them slowly and more than once.  Unlike those dreaded, impenetrably thick volumes from our high school and college English classes, this collection is not made up of hallowed dead white male authors&#151with a few female tokens thrown in&#151whose sterling reputations as the best in the world precluded our ever taking a liking to them. For one thing, the gay and lesbian writers here, besides being young, fresh and cool, are not hemmed in by the usual categories; the prose is often poetic, the poems dramatic, and the plays at times read like classic narratives in the best Twain and Wetly oral traditions.  It is the adventurous blending and reshaping of genres, handled with enviable sophistication, that impresses the most.  Their heritage is Asian (in itself a polyglot of influences), with all the familial traditions, structures, and expectations to spark rebellion and angst, but these writers, whether immigrant or U.S.-born, are American through and through in their perceptions and speech&#151and in their contempt for history's oppressive shadow.  As Richard Kiamco puts it in his "Powershowgirl: Unaccessorized": "Originally, I'm from the Midwest, born in the cornfields of Illinois.  But I was abducted by Asians.  More specifically, overachieving Filipinos."  There are bound to be flaws in such an ambitious mix.  A few of the works read like creative writing exercises, some of the humor is painful adolescent banter, and there is an understandable tendency at times to try and say everything as fully and fast as possible.  But many a piece is pared down, carved to a professional finish, and each bears its own elliptical and original voice, as in Philip Huang's haunting stories "Baby," and "The Interview."  The latter even pulls off the most fiendishly difficult of POVs, second person.  Then there are Larissa Lai's retakes on fairy tales, "the Salt Fish Girl" and "Fish Bones"&#151satirical and sly but steeped in the traditions of both Asian and European folklore.  It would take the length of a book just to give the rest of them honorable mention.  Luckily, <i>Take Out</i> does that for us better than any review.
