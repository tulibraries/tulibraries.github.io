      <p>Story by Amanda Haverstick
      <p>Some people spend hours carefully crafting their scrapbooks, but others 
        spend hours researching them. Since the late 1980s, Patricia Buckler, 
        an associate professor of English at Purdue University-North Central, 
        has been studying what people put on the pages of their scrapbooks. &quot;(A 
        scrapbook) gives us a look at what was done in the past,&quot; Buckler 
        said. &quot;Each scrapbook is tailored by the person who made it.&quot;
      <p> Buckler, along with Susan Tucker and Katherine Ott, has edited a new 
        book that looks at the history of scrapbooks, <em><a href="../titles/1843_reg.html" target="_top">The 
        Scrapbook in American Life</a></em>. &quot;It's everywhere,&quot; Buckler 
        said of scrapbooking. &quot;Everybody has done it forever.&quot; Her interest 
        in scrapbooks began after looking through the contents of a family scrapbook 
        from the 1840s. &quot;I started out researching a scrapbook from my husband's 
        family that was given to him when his father died,&quot; Buckler said. 
        The scrapbook, which was actually in pieces, contained clippings of poems, 
        hand painted pictures of birds and a clipping of opera singer Jenny Lind.
      <p> Buckler started looking for scrapbooks from the same period in other 
        places. She visited a number of universities that had scrapbooks in their 
        collections. &quot;I started on ante-bellum scrapbooks,&quot; she said. 
        &quot;I didn't want to get involved in photo albums.&quot;
      <p> During her research Buckler came in contact with Tucker, who is curator 
        of Books and Records at the Newcomb College Center for Research on Women 
        at Tulane University. Tucker, she found, had done some research on scrapbooks. 
        &quot;The next time I was in New Orleans we got together,&quot; Buckler 
        said. &quot;We talked about the different aspects of scrapbooks. We decided 
        we wanted to do a book on scrapbooks.&quot;
      <p> She also came in contact with Ott, who is curator in the Division of 
        Science and Medicine at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American 
        History. Buckler said she was curious as to who made scrapbooks and what 
        region they came from. &quot;We thought at first more women would be keeping 
        scrapbooks than men,&quot; Buckler said. &quot;We, however, found a lot 
        of men kept scrapbooks.&quot; Buckler said men tended to make themed scrapbooks 
        relating to their profession or history. &quot;I saw one kept by some 
        man in Georgia. He kept clippings in the scrapbook of engagements of a 
        Civil War unit that came from his town,&quot; Buckler said. 
      <p>Women's scrapbooks, said Buckler, were more personal and included souvenirs 
        like dance cards and handmade items. &quot;(There were) souvenirs from 
        special events in their lives,&quot; Buckler said. &quot;Young women were 
        collecting print portraits of famous people. They would come like a bonus 
        in magazines.&quot; Women's scrapbooks also included a good amount of 
        clippings. &quot;It was a very literate culture,&quot; Buckler said. &quot;They 
        clipped articles about being a good wife, being a good mother and how 
        to do things in the home in a better way.&quot;
      <p>In her research, Buckler found a set of scrapbooks in the Pennsylvania 
        Historical Society that contained articles on the Mexican War from 1846 
        to 1848. &quot;It was a real treasure trove of information,&quot; Buckler 
        said.
      <p>Organizations keep scrapbooks and many people, said Buckler, have kept 
        family scrapbooks. &quot;A lot of them have never been put in archives,&quot; 
        Buckler said. &quot;A lot of them we haven't been able to see.&quot;<br>
        Buckler also has studied contemporary scrapbooks. In the last few years 
        supplies for scrapbooks have managed to eat up at least an aisle of a 
        hobby or craft store.
      <p>&quot;I think the idea is the same &#8249; to preserve in book form memories 
        of special people and special events,&quot; Buckler said. &quot;It's a 
        $5 billion business today. There are all kinds of groups that get together 
        to do what they call crops.&quot;
      <p>Buckler, who ironically does not have a scrapbook, said she has enjoyed 
        her research. &quot;It feels good to have done some so-called ground-breaking 
        research,&quot; Buckler said.
