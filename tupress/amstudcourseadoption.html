		<h4>Toby Miller</h4>

		<p>A crisp and engaging book that proposes how to save the dying humanities</p>

		<p>By the author of <a href="http://www.temple.edu/tempress/titles/1571_reg.html"><em>Sportsex</em></a> and <a href="http://www.temple.edu/tempress/titles/1805_reg.html"><em>Cultural Citizenship: Cosmopolitanism, Consumerism, and Television in a Neoliberal Age</em></a>.</p>

		<p>A short, sharp, and provocative book, <em>Blow Up the Humanities</em> has esteemed scholar Toby Miller declaring that there are two humanities in the United States. One is the venerable, powerful humanities of private universities; the other is the humanities of state schools, which focus mainly on job prospects. There is a class division between the two&#8213;both in terms of faculty research and student background&#8213;and it must end.</p>

		<h3><a href="http://www.temple.edu/tempress/titles/2200_reg.html">Vigilantes and Lynch Mobs</a></h3>
		<h3>Narratives of Community and Nation</h3>
		<h4>Lisa Arellano</h4>

		<p>Vigilantes and lynch mobs not only usurped the authority of the law, they shaped the histories of their actions</p>

		<p>Looking at the narrative accounts of mob violence produced by vigilantes and their advocates as "official" histories, Lisa Arellano shows how these nonfiction narratives conformed to a common formula whose purpose was to legitimate frontier justice and lynching.</p>

		<p>"Vigilantes and Lynch Mobs <em>is more interested in the historiography of the vigilante/lynchings narratives than in the histories, which makes it unique. Using close readings of lynching stories/narratives from several genres&#8213;notably archival sources, printed contemporary accounts, and printed histories&#8213;Arellano seeks to understand emergent narratives about lynchings, and how Ida. B. Wells disrupted the accepted narrative formula (which justified lynchings). Arellano has identified&#8213;through careful research and close readings&#8213;an alternative mythology legitimating violence in pursuit of order and justice.</em>"<br />

		<h3><a href="http://www.temple.edu/tempress/titles/2162_reg.html">Picturing Model Citizens</a></h3>
		<h3>Civility in Asian American Visual Culture</h3>
		<h4>Thy Phu</h4>

		<p>How images portraying Asians as civil subjects contribute to debates on Asian American citizenship

		<p>At the heart of the model minority myth&#8213;often associated with Asian Americans&#8213;is the concept of civility. In this groundbreaking book, <em>Picturing Model Citizens</em>, Thy Phu exposes the complex links between civility and citizenship, and argues that civility plays a crucial role in constructing Asian American citizenship.</p>

		<p>"Picturing Model Citizens <em>is a valuable contribution to the growing scholarship on Asian America and visual culture. Phu articulates a subtle and very useful trope of 'civility' by which to account for the chasm between the demonized coolie and idolized model minority, between labor and citizenship. This theorization and a well-grounded deployment of visual culture, enables sophisticated close readings of several important sets of photographs in which Asian American subjects are featured. Phu's extensive contextualization and detailed and sophisticated readings of the photographs are rewarding and generative.</em> Picturing Model Citizens <em>is likely to be widely used and cited.</em>"<br />

		<h3>African American Writers between the Nation and the World</h3>
		<h4>Eve Dunbar</h4>

		<p>Establishing an imaginative space for blackness, four mid-century American writers resist literary segregation</p>

		<p>Zora Neale Hurston, Richard Wright, James Baldwin, and Chester Himes were all pressured by critics and publishers to enlighten mainstream (white) audiences about race and African American culture. Focusing on fiction and non-fiction they produced between the Harlem Renaissance and the Black Arts Movement, Eve Dunbar's important book, Black Regions of the Imagination, examines how these African American writers&#8213;who lived and traveled outside the United States&#8213;both document and re-imagine their "homegrown" racial experiences within a worldly framework.</p>

		<h3><a href="http://www.temple.edu/tempress/titles/2066_reg.html">Prisons and Patriots</a></h3>
		<h3>Japanese American Wartime Citizenship, Civil Disobedience, and Historical Memory</h3>
		<h4>Cherstin M. Lyon</h4>

		<p>Reexamining wartime definitions of citizenship, patriotism, prisons, and civil disobedience through the lives of Gordon Hirabayashi and the Tucsonians</p>

		<p>Prisons and Patriots provides a detailed account of forty-one Nisei (second-generation Japanese Americans), known as the Tucsonians, who were imprisoned for resisting the draft during WWII. Cherstin Lyon parallels their courage as resisters with that of civil rights hero Gordon Hirabayashi, well known for his legal battle against curfew and internment, who also resisted the draft. These dual stories highlight the intrinsic relationship between the rights and the obligations of citizenship, particularly salient in times of war.</p>

		<p>"<em>Historically strong and emotionally powerful, this book shows that the prisons created the patriots, and it does them justice by honoring their actions correctly. Highly Recommended.</em>"<br />

		<p>How Black women's engagement in improving health and fitness raises questions about feminism and the construction of black female identity</p>

		<p>In her award-winning ethnographic study, <em>Body Language</em>, Kimberly Lau traces the multiple ways in which the success of an innovative fitness program illuminates what identity means to its Black female clientele and how their group interaction provides a new perspective on feminist theories of identity politics&#8213;especially regarding the significance of identity to political activism and social change.</p>

		<p>The role of cultural elites and journalists in promoting reading as a means of self-improvement and social mobility</p>
