              <li>What new or innovative labor practices and institutions emerged 
                  in the colonial era?
            </ul> 
            <p><strong>Chapter 2. Labor and Liberty in the Formation of the Nation, 
              1760-1830</strong>
			<ul><li>What did the concept "liberty" mean to labor? How was liberty 
                  related to economic opportunity?<p>
              <li>What was the social and political place of labor in early national 
                  society? 
            </ul>

              and Democracy, Civil War, 1830-1865</strong>
			<ul>
              <li>How did labor begin to organize collectively in the early national 
                  period?<p>
              <li>What part did law play in the relationship between labor and 
                  capital during these years?<p>
              <li>What commonalities existed between the early goals of labor, 
                  women's rights advocates, and abolitionists?
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Chapter 4. The Heroic Age of Labor; The Days of the "Martyrs

              <li>Who were some of the "martyrs and saints" of this period? Why 
                  are they thought of that way?<p>
              <li>What was the place of black labor, female labor, and immigrant 
                  labor in the total picture of work during this era?

                  did business respond?<p> 
              <li>What is the place of technology in the relationship between 
                  labor and capital? Why does labor generally resist the new technology 
                  that other workers create, even when it relieves burdens or 
                  removes certain hazards?<p> 
              <li>Why were important concessions given to some labor organizations 
                  during this era? Describe these concessions. Which labor groups

              <li>How did labor unions respond to the onset of the Great Depression? 
                  How did workers react to it? 
            </ul>

              1945-1968</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Why was the Cold War period a time of both advances and setbacks 
                  for labor? What were those gains and losses.<p>

              <li>Were the interests of labor better served by one political
