<BR>&mdash;<b>The Philadelphia Daily News</b></I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>On February 2, 1968, the Electric Factory, Philadelphia's first major venue for the era's new music, opened with a show featuring the Chambers Brothers. Performing their neosoul and gospel sounds in a warm and inviting venue, they declared, "My soul's been psychedelicized!"-a feeling that the Factory's cofounder, Larry Magid, has been experiencing ever since.</p>

<p>In <em>My Soul's Been Psychedelicized</em>, Magid presents a spectacular photographic history of the bands and solo acts that have performed at the Electric Factory and at other venues in Factory-produced concerts over the past four decades. The book includes concert posters, photographs, and promotional items featuring both rising stars and established performers, such as Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Bette Midler, Elvis Presley, Tina Turner, Pearl Jam and many, many more.</p>

<p>The images—candid and celebratory—create a one-of-a-kind history of rock and roll,  from the wild 1960s to the Live Aid concert in 1985 and the closing of the Philadelphia Spectrum in 2009. Magid's vivid recollections constitute a who's who of pop music and culture. As one of the great concert producers, he shares his unique perspective on the business, talking about how it has changed and how lasting careers have been carefully developed.</p>

<p>For anyone who has ever attended a concert at the Electric Factory—or for anyone who missed a show—<em>My Soul's Been Psychedelicized</em> will bring back great memories of the music and the musicians.</p>
<BR>&nbsp;<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p><i>"Music buff and music historian alike will find a lot to be intrigued about with the coffee-table book dedicated to one of Philadelphia’s premier music venues and the concert promotion company that shares its name.... This gorgeous, colorful and glossy book is chock full of concert posters, live photos and stories about some of the more legendary shows through the years.... [T]his book makes a great addition to any music lover’s library.... [I]t is wonderful to read about and see pictures of the first time Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Elton John and Pink Floyd played the modest-sized club/theater in Philadelphia on the way to super-stardom.... [A]n entertaining read and a nice slab of visual music history."</i><br> &#151<b><i>Philadelphia Gay News</i></b>

<p><i>"[A]n entertaining and informative recap of Magid's career....</i>My Soul's Been Psychedelicized<i> offers a treasure trove of more than 200 photographs and concert posters, ranging from a youthful Pete Townshend performing “Tommy” in 1969 to Pearl Jam closing the Spectrum in 2009. This book is a journey through the past worth taking." </i><br> &#151<b><i>The Golden Times</i></b>
