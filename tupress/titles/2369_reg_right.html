  <P><I>"A semi-ethnographic examination of efforts in one U.S. city to curb gentrification by harnessing the paradoxical power of the condominium to mitigate turnover even as it generates it. </i>The Politics of Staying Put<I> is a deeply researched study of tenant empowerment that makes an important contribution to debates in the social sciences about displacement, neighborhood governance, and apartment living, challenging the dominant view of the condo as yuppie. Rich fieldwork and case studies illustrate how communities can&#151and cannot&#151successfully challenge the market in an era of rapid urban transformation."</i>

When cities gentrify, it can be hard for working-class and low-income residents to stay put. Rising rents and property taxes make buildings unaffordable, or landlords may sell buildings to investors interested in redeveloping them into luxury condos. <br>
<p>In her engaging study <i>The Politics of Staying Put, </i>Carolyn Gallaher focuses on a formal, city-sponsored initiative&#8212;The Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act (TOPA)&#8212;that helps people keep their homes. This law, unique to the District of Columbia, allows tenants in apartment buildings contracted for sale the right to refuse the sale and purchase the building instead. In the hands of tenants, a process that would usually hurt them&#8212;conversion to a condominium or cooperative&#8212;can instead help them.  <br>
<p>Taking a broad, city-wide assessment of TOPA, Gallaher follows seven buildings through the program's process. She measures the law's level of success and its constraints<i>. </i>Her findings<i> </i>have relevance for debates in urban affairs about condo conversion, urban local autonomy, and displacement.

<i>"</i>The Politics of Staying Put <i> is an engaging, well-researched book on a fairly under-researched topic. Gallaher provides an in-depth case study of condominium conversion and a policy designed to dampen the negative outcomes associated with this process.</i><i> She </i><i>illustrates conditions and outcomes that do not fall neatly in categories typically used to discuss and critique gentrification and neoliberalism, thereby complicating our understanding of the role of condo conversion in displacement. This book is an important theoretical contribution to the literature</i>."
<br/>&#8212;<b>Lance Freeman</b>, Professor, Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation, Columbia University and author of <i>There Goes the 'Hood: Views of Gentrification from the Ground Up </i>(Temple)<br>
<p><i>"</i>Staying Put <i> offers students of Washington history a sketch of the economic and demographic trends that have shaped life and political discourse in D.C. communities in the early decades of the home-rule city. The volume will be particularly valuable for those curious about why and how well-intentioned social justice policy may miss its mark or who are interested in wrestling with the question of how policy might be better engineered. Gallaher's work contributes to the general study of America's millennial cities by showing what the urban struggle to accommodate public objectives and market forces has looked like in D.C. under limited home rule.</i>"

<p>The <em>Urban Life, Landscape, and Policy</em> Series, edited by David Stradling, Larry Bennett, and Davarian Baldwin, was founded by the late Zane L. Miller to publish books that examine past and contemporary cities, focusing on cultural and social issues. The editors seek proposals that analyze processes of urban change relevant to the future of cities and their metropolitan regions, and that examine urban and regional planning, environmental issues, and urban policy studies, thus contributing to ongoing debates. </p></P>
