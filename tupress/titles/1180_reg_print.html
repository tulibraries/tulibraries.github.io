<P><P>This unique interdisciplinary collection, compiled by the editors of the <I>University of Pennsylvania Law Review</I>, brings together the leading essays on family law in the United States.  The authors&#151law professors, judges, public interest practitioners, and law students&#151express a variety of viewpoints and perspectives on law and public policy issues affecting children.  Children, their parents, and the state create a triangle in which the "best interests of the child" often become lost.  Covering a range of issues from child abuse, public education, and juvenile crime to drug addiction, homelessness, AIDS, and free speech, these accessible essays present rigorous debates about the rights of children within the social services, educational, health care, and criminal justice systems.</p>
