<BLOCKQUOTE><I>"Very thoroughly researched in traditional and non-traditional sources, well-organized, and gracefully written, the volume will be of particular value of readers interested in immigration, ethnicity, labor, and the American West." </I><br>&#151<b><I>Choice</I></b><I></I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Between 1870 and 1942, successive generations of Asians and Asian Americans&#151predominantly Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino&#151formed the predominant body of workers in the Pacific Coast canned-salmon industry. 

<p>This study traces the shifts in the ethnic and gender composition of the cannery labor market from its origins through it decline and examines the workers' creation of work cultures and social communities.  Resisting the label of cheap laborer, these Asian American workers established formal and informal codes of workplace behavior, negotiated with contractors and recruiters, and formed alliances to organize the workforce.

<p>Whether he is discussing Japanese women workers' sharing of child-care responsibilities or the role of Filipino workers in establishing the Cannery and Field Workers Union, Chris Friday portrays Asian and Asian American workers as people who, while enduring oppressive restrictions, continually attempted to shape their own lives.
<BR>&nbsp;<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p><I>"An important book, addressing a major topic in ethnic, industrial, labor, and Western history with extraordinary rich coverage of the Chinese and Japanese and Filipinos in the Pacific Coast canned-salmon industry.  The research can only be described as awesome, quite extraordinary....This is a book which carries historical riches of value not only within but beyond the boundaries of this specific topic."</I>

Scott Wong, Linda Trinh V�, and Cathy Schlund-Vials.
</p><p>Founded by Sucheng Chan in 1991, the <I>Asian American History and Culture</I>, series has sponsored innovative scholarship that has redefined, expanded, and advanced the field of Asian American studies while strengthening its links to related areas of scholarly inquiry and engaged critique. Like the field from which it emerged, the series remains rooted in the social sciences and humanities, encompassing multiple regions, formations, communities, and identities. Extending the vision of founding editor Sucheng Chan and emeriti editor Michael Omi and David Palumbo-Liu, series editors K. Scott Wong, Linda Trinh V�, and Cathy Schlund-Vials continue to develop a foundational collection that embodies a range of theoretical and methodological approaches to Asian American studies.</p>
