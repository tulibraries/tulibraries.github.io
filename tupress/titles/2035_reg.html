</P><BLOCKQUOTE><I>"Huntington�s emphasis on the interconnections of the related arts�music, poetry, fiction, oral tradition etc.�is one of the few to treat systematically, and in a sound, sophisticated theoretical and ethnographic framework, the important traits of African literary, oral and musical productions. </i>Sounding Off<i> will make a great contribution to the interdisciplinary study and thus provide a deeper understanding of musical and literary-artistic productions in African and diasporan communities." <BR><B>&#151Daniel Avorgbedor</B>, Ohio State University, Columbus</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Intrigued by "texted" sonorities&#151the rhythms, musics, ordinary noises, and sounds of language in narratives&#151Julie Huntington examines the soundscapes in contemporary Francophone novels. Through an ethnomusicological perspective, Huntington argues that the range of sounds�from footsteps, heartbeats, and drumbeats�represented in West African and Caribbean works provides a context in which identities are shaped and negotiated.</p>

<p><i>Sounding Off</i> attends to how sounds function in such as Ousmane Sembene's <i>God's Bits of Wood</i> (Senegal), and Patrick Chamoiseau's <i>Solibo Magnificent</i> (Martinique). These writers&#151like composers&#151create distinct soundscapes, constructing transpoetic and transcultural links that resonate.  The voices, cadences, and sonorities in these narratives create a rich soundtrack to the characters' lives, framing them with a rhythmic polyphony that helps form social and cultural identities. Huntington�s analysis shows how these writers and others challenge the aesthetic and political conventions that privilege written texts over orality and invite readers-listeners to participate in critical dialogues&#151to sound off, as it were, in local and global communities. </p>

<BR>&nbsp;<h2>Reviews</h2>
<P><i>"Huntington finds new ways to read often-compared West African and Caribbean Francophone novels and offers fascinating insights into language and culture. Her concept of �instrumentaliture,� along with her referencing of African scholars, discussion of drum language, funerals, and </i>veill�es<i>, is original. </i>Sounding Off<i> will appeal to scholars of African, Caribbean, Diaspora, and comparative literature, and popular culture."</I> <BR><B>&#151Ren�e Larrier</B>,  Rutgers University

<p><i>"Particularly impressive is a lengthy discussion in which she introduces the reader to the role of music, rhythm, and other sounding phenomena in West African life....[T]he study is valuable in establishing, or reestablishing, the element of music and rhythm as part of the vital context for Francophone African and Caribbean literary works. Summing Up: Recommended" </i>
<br>&#151<b><i>CHOICE</i></b>

<p><i>"[Huntington] revisits the subject of orality and identity in her study of West African and Caribbean francophone novels.... At times, </i>Sounding Off<i> reads like a travel book, as we follow her to a small village in West Africa where she is welcomed and sensitized to the importance of rhythm to everyday life....</i>Sounding Off<i> is at its best when it opens up new critical terrain with the concept of instrumentaliture."</i>
