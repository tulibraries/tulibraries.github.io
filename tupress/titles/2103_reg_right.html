<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>"</i>As French as Everyone Else?<i> is a timely, unique, and major contribution. Brouard and Tiberj—leading French political science researchers—offer a concise book on the important case of France. Given the relatively large size of the country’s immigrant population and its political and social significance, its study is especially relevant.  These scholars examine in depth the cultural, political, and religious attitudes of this very important community. It is one about which little is known, in a scientific sense, until now."</I>

<p>France is often depicted as the model of assimilationist or republican integration in the international literature on immigration. However, rarely have surveys drilled down to provide individual responses from a double representative sample. In <em>As French as Everyone Else?</em>, Sylvain Brouard and Vincent Tiberj provide a comprehensive assessment of the state of integration in France by systematically comparing the "new French" immigrants, as well as their children and grandchildren born in France, with a sample of the French general population.</p>

<p>The authors' survey considers a wide range of topics, including religious affiliation and religiosity, political attitudes and political efficacy, value systems (including gender roles, work ethics, and anti-Semitism), patterns of integration, multiple identities and national belongings, and affirmative action. As the authors show, despite existing differences, immigrants of Maghrebin, African, and Turkish origin share a wide scope of commonality with other French citizens </p>
