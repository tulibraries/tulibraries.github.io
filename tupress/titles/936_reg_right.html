<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>"Dipert has broken entirely new ground here: this work is at the cutting edge.  Dipert is not afraid to take stands on important and difficult philosophical questions."</I>
<br>&#151<b>Peter Kivy</b>, Rutgers University<I></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>In this first book-length philosophical study of artifacts, Randall Dipert develops a theory of what artifacts are and applies it extensively to one of the most complex and intriguing kinds of artifacts, art works.  He defines agents, intentions, and actions, using these notions to clarify what it is for an agent to "make" something.  From this starting point, he develops a full theory of artifacts and other artificial things&#151and especially a theory of art works and performances of art works as artifacts.  He proposes a theory of nature and of the value of nature as what is essentially non-artificial.

<p>Believing that a developed philosophy of mind is necessary for a developed aesthetics and philosophy of art, Dipert relies upon classical and contemporary research on agency, on actions and intentions, and on the Intentionalist theory of mental objects of Bretano and Meinong.  He considers physical entities, thoughts, utterances, and performances as artifacts.  This vast category encompasses everyday household objects and tools, streets and edifices, as well as communicative and artistic artifacts.

<p>Especially with regard to artistic artifacts, Dipert proposes a theory of expression and communication as actions and extensively discusses the problems of interpreting and recognizing actions, artifacts, and art works.
