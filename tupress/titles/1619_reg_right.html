<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>"In an era dominated by television and increasingly focused on the Internet as the new kid on the media block, Miller offers a valuable history lesson by reminding us of the power once yielded by radio. The best inoculation against the hyperbolic claims of new media is to understand the commonalities as well as the unique features of the various media that have shaped public consciousness in the past century.  In this still unfolding narrative, radio has often been overlooked or taken for granted.  Miller helps us avoid these mistakes and should encourage us all to take another, closer listen to the voices in the ether."</I>
<br>&#151<b>Larry Gross</b>, Sol Worth Professor, The Annenberg School for Communication, University of Pennsylvania<I></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>The voice we hear on the radio&#151the voice with no body attached&#151is a key element in the history of media in the twentieth century. Before television and the internet, there was radio; and much of what defined the makeup of these newer media was influenced by the way radio was broadcast to people and the way people listened to it.

<p><I>Emergency Broadcasting</I> focuses on key moments in the history of early radio in order to come to an understanding of the role voice played in radio to describe national crises, a fictional invasion from outer space, and general entertainment. Taking the Hindenburg disaster, <I>The War of the Worlds</I> hoax, Franklin Roosevelt's Fireside Chats, and the serial mystery <I>The Shadow</I> as his focal points, Edward Miller illustrates how the radio, for the first time, instantly communicated to a mass audience, and how that communication&#151where the voice counts more than the image&#151is still at work today in television and the World Wide Web.

<p>Theoretically sophisticated, yet grounded in historical detail, <I>Emergency Broadcasting</I> offers a unique examination of radio and at the same time develops a complex understanding of the media whose birth is owed to the innovations&#151and disembodied power&#151established by it.

<P><p><I>"Miller's book is a wholly original contribution to the study of both early American and contemporary radio. Perhaps his greatest strength is his ability to integrate theory with historical evidence. Miller's reading of both the "War of the Worlds" and FDR's Fireside Chats as being inflected by the radio reporting of the </I>Hindenberg<I> disaster is as unique as it is valuable. </I>Emergency Broadcasting<I> belongs alongside other significant radio books such as </I>Noise Water Meat<I> and </I>Wireless Imagination<I>."</I>
<br>&#151<b>Martin Spinelli</b>, Ph.D., Professor of Radio and Media Studies, Brooklyn College of the City University of New York

<p><i>"Miller adds a theoretical context with which to assess these programs, and he effectively ties his findings to radio (and Internet) content available today. His approach is surely timely for he is really exploring how radio dealt (and deals) with real or imagined threats to national security."</i>
