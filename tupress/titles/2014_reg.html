</P><P>Thomas Hauser has been called “one of boxing’s greatest writers".  <I>The Boxing Scene</I>, Hauser’s provocative new anthology, contains all of his trademark insights and candor as he peels away layers of hypocrisy to reveal the men who make up the contemporary boxing landscape.</P>

<P>Hauser exposes the inner workings of HBO Sports; examines the phenomenon of mixed martial arts as it relates to boxing; and records the amusing encounter between his 81-year-old mother and larger-than-life boxing impresario Don King. <I>The Boxing Scene</I> also updates Hauser’s personal and professional thoughts on superstars like Oscar De La Hoya, Floyd Mayweather Jr., Ricky Hatton, Miguel Cotto, and Bernard Hopkins as well as fight promoter Bob Arum, announcer Bob Sheridan and a host of others.</P>

<P><I>The Boxing Scene</I> recreates another year in professional boxing and adds to Hauser’s definitive record of the sport.</P>

<BR>&nbsp;<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p><i>"Thomas Hauser is back with his latest compilation of boxing features and columns, this one entitled </i>'The Boxing Scene'<i>. The boxing insider’s insider, Hauser continues to amaze with hard-hitting pieces that get right to the heart of this sometimes seedy business. But it’s not all doom and gloom, as evidenced by in-depth looks at John Duddy, Kelly Pavlik, Bernard Hopkins, and Miguel Cotto, along with more lighthearted pieces such as those on press conference food spreads and the time Hauser’s mother met Don King. While you may not always agree with his take on things (I particularly take issue with his piece on mixed martial arts), you will always be captivated by his work. Highly recommended."</i>

<p><i>"[Hauser's] fascination with boxing began in the late 1970s.... What draws him to the fight game is his fascination with the people who populate the business: fighters, trainers, promoters, broadcasters, and even strippers, one of whom, Tempest Storm, a sharecropper's daughter who counts Elvis and JFK among her lovers, is the subject of one of this volume's most affecting profiles.... Hauser remains one of the best [boxing writers]...this volume...[is] damn good." </i>

</p><p>As an international cultural activity for athleticism, spectatorship, and global cultural exchange, sport is unmatched by any other force on earth. And yet it remains a consistently understudied dimension of history and cultural studies. <i>Sporting</i>, edited by Amy Bass, aims to contribute to the study of sport by publishing works by people across a range of disciplines, by professional sportswriters, and by athletes to add substance to our still emerging notion of globalization.</p>
