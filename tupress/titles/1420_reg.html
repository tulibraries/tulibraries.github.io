<BR>&#151<B>James M. Freeman</B>, author of <I>Changing Identities: Vietnamese Americans 1975-1995</I><I></I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>The first biography of an American-born Korean woman, <i>Doing What Had to Be Done </i>is, on the surface, the life story of Dora Yum Kim.  But telling more than one woman's story, author Soo-Young Chin offers more than an unusual glimpse at the shaping of a remarkable community activist.  In addition&#151as she questions her subject, introduces each chapter, and reflects on how Dora's story relates to her own experience as a Korean-American who immigrated to this country as an adult&#151she carves around Dora's compelling and courageous life story, a story of her own and one of all Korean-Americans. 

<p>Born in 1921, Dora, as she tells Chin her story, chronicles the shifting salience of gendered ethnic identity as she journeys through her life. Traveling through time and place, she moves from San Francisco's Chinatown&#151where Koreans were a minority within a minority&#151to suburban Dewey Boulevard where Dora and her family attempt to integrate into mainstream America and where she becomes a social worker in the California State Department of Employment.  As the Korean immigrant community grows in the late 1960s, Dora becomes deeply involved in community service.  She remembers teaching English to senior citizens and preparing them for their naturalization exams, finding jobs for the younger Koreans, and founding a community center and meals program for seniors.

<p>A detailed and inspiring lens through which to view Korean-American history, Dora's life journey echoes the changing spaces of the American social landscape.  The grace and ease with which Dora just "does what has to be done" shows us the importance of everyday acts in making a difference.

<BR>&nbsp;<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p><i>"...a wonderfully nuanced portrait of the lives of Koreans and Korean Americans in the US, as well as a powerful meditation on the meanings of "Americanness" in the late twentieth century. [Chin] also addresses theoretical issues relating to traditions of Western and Asian autobiography&#151and ethnography in terms a non-anthropologist can grasp, while the footnotes add another layer of analysis for the specialist."</i>

</p><p>Founded by Sucheng Chan in 1991, the <I>Asian American History and Culture</I>, series has sponsored innovative scholarship that has redefined, expanded, and advanced the field of Asian American studies while strengthening its links to related areas of scholarly inquiry and engaged critique. Like the field from which it emerged, the series remains rooted in the social sciences and humanities, encompassing multiple regions, formations, communities, and identities. Extending the vision of founding editor Sucheng Chan and emeriti editor Michael Omi and David Palumbo-Liu, series editors K. Scott Wong, Linda Trinh Võ, and Cathy Schlund-Vials continue to develop a foundational collection that embodies a range of theoretical and methodological approaches to Asian American studies.</p>
