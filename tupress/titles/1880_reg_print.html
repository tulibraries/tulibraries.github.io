<P><p>The Mummers Parade is like no other parade in the world. With 10,000 wildly-costumed participants stepping out every New Year's Day in South Philadelphia, it is one of the most spectacular annual parades in the U.S. This remarkable book is a "family portrait" of the parade. It presents, in pictures and in words, the flamboyantly-attired Mummers and reveals the everyday, working-class people beneath the outrageous garb.
<p>
Noted photographer E. A. Kennedy spent four years documenting the Mummers and their parade. He has personally selected the striking images included here-more than150 in all-and he has written an engaging history of the Parade itself. As Kennedy explains, and as his photos make clear, "mummery" is a way of life for Mummers, who have deep attachments to their clubs, associations and brigades.
<p>
For all its glitz, the Mummers Parade remains a folk parade. This is the captivating story of the folks behind the parade.</p>

<p><I>"Our clubhouse is like a church; it becomes spiritual. There's a lot of love here. A lot of guys don't have family. We're their family." </I><br>&#151<b>Bill Murtha</b> age 55, a retired UPS truck driver

<p><i>�At first glance, Kennedy�s appears to be a picture book�a large format collection of color photographs from four years of mumming. Examined more closely, however, Kennedy�s words prove as insightful as his photographs.... Kennedy has assembled a body of images and an informed commentary that gives form and color to these forces of continuity and change.�</i> <br>&#151;<b><i>Western Folklore</i></b>
