</P><BLOCKQUOTE><I>"[Far�as'] book includes more concrete information relevant to Heidegger's relations with the Nazis than anything else available, and it is an excellent antidote to the evasive apologetics that are still being published."</I>
<br>&#151<b>Richard Rorty</b>, <I>The New Republic</I><I></I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Originally published in a French translation in 1987, this controversial work has received a tumultuous reception throughout Europe and continues to be the object of intense debate. In this first English edition, Victor Farias tracks the career of Martin Heidegger&#151one of the most influential figures in twentieth-century philosophy&#151and documents his intimate involvement with Nazism for much of his professional life.

<p>Although scholars have long known about Heidegger�s early commitment to National Socialism, it was generally thought that he became disenchanted with Hitler well before the outbreak of World War II. After more than a decade of solitary study in a variety of archives, Farias presents a carefully constructed case in which he reveals Heidegger�s initial adherence to Hitler�s Nazism and his subsequent development of a more personal version of National Socialism. Heidegger�s devotion to those themes was always at the center of his mature thought, appears to have preceded his election as rector of the University of Freiburg, and was sustained to the end of his life. Farias examines with great care and persistence the charge that Heidegger, who died in 1976, was a life-long anti-Semite. He notes that the philosopher praised Hitler to his colleagues and refused, even after the war, to criticize Nazi atrocities and genocide, or to recant his earlier Nazism. 

<p>While Heidegger previously had appeared at worst naive by his acceptance of the Third Reich, Farias� evidence shows him to be the only major philosopher who freely embraced Nazism&#151the undisputed example of absolute evil in modern times. This damage to the official myth about Heidegger�s involvement raises questions about the relationship between politics and philosophy, about the presumed link between philosophy and virtue, and about what we may understand by the betrayal of reason in our time. 

<p><I>Heidegger and Nazism</I> transforms the setting in which Heidegger�s standing will henceforth be assessed. From his earliest intellectual and emotional influences to the last posthumously published interview with <I>Der Spiegel</I>, Heidegger�s connection to National Socialism is shown to be a matter of conviction rather than necessary compromise as apologists still contend. Farias shows the reasonableness of linking the ideology and the philosophy and suggests where to probe to draw out detailed connections The book forces us to ponder the question of whether certain philosophical strategies and doctrines&#151particularly associated with Heidegger�s existential hermeneutics and the effect of his themes on the development of deconstruction&#151are not merely indefensible but peculiarly hospitable to the kind of "principled" falsification that fascists require. Providing the context for a close re-reading of Heidegger, this significant and historic work challenges the philosophical community to assess the full import of Heidegger�s life on his influential conception of philosophy and his resolution of particular philosophical problems.

<BR>&nbsp;<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p><i>"Fascinating material for a study of a philosopher who would seem to have cooperated eagerly with the false promises of tyranny."</i>
<br>&#151<b>Allen Lacy</b>, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>

<p><i>"A major work in the controversy over Heidegger's connection with Nazism... it also offers a fascinating look into the academic world of Hitler's Germany."</i>
<br>&#151<b><i>Choice</i></b>

<p><I>"The most serious and pointed inquiry ever made of the political activities of Heidegger....  One thing is certain...one can never again, after Far�as' book, approach Heidegger as we did before....  How [has] all modern thought...been able to make the most important philosophy of the century from a philosophy which did not utter a word about genocide?  Heidegger, a Nazi?  Without doubt."</I>
<br>&#151<b>Robert Maggiori</b>, <I>Lib�ration</I>

<p><I>"Far�as has demonstrated that [Heidegger's] political engagement was even deeper and more enduring than had previously been suspected."</I>
<br>&#151<b><I>The Times Literary Supplement</I></b>

<p><I>"The significant achievement of Far�as' </I>Heidegger and Nazism<I> is that it established beyond doubt Heidegger's commitment to Nazism and his involvement in the activities of the Nazi regime; it establishes also that the connection between Heidegger's philosophy and Nazism is essential and that it constitutes an inescapable project for further philosophic research."</I>
