</P><BLOCKQUOTE><I><i>"</i>Psychiatry and Behavioral Science<i> is a well crafted, simply written, comprehensive review of evidenced-based psychiatric theory and practice. Edited by two leaders in psychiatric education--one of whom, David Baron, is an internationally acclaimed psychopharmacologist--it provides not only medical students but also all health professionals regardless of subspecialty or years of experience a comprehensive review of the state of the art of psychiatry. The charts and references to critical recent contributions to the literature provided throughout the volume coupled with multiple-choice review exams at the end of each chapter make it particularly useful for preparation for board and recertification examinations. I recommend it to all both within the medical profession as well outside of it to read and enjoy."</i>
<br><b>&#151Andrew E. Slaby, MD, PhD, MPH,</b>, Clinical Professor of Psychiatry, New York University and New York Medical College</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>This uniquely formatted text that combines introductory psychiatry content with board-style review questions has been written as a useful guide for first- and second-year medical students and other mental health professional students. <i>Psychiatry and Behavioral Science</i> is intended to be used as an indispensible text for pre-clinical psychiatric education. The user-friendly split page format includes clinical vignettes, �fast facts,� and relevant art work. Each chapter contains board review questions that prepare the medical student for the USMLE and COMLEX examinations. By using a clinical approach consistent with the needs of today�s medical and mental health profession students, the authors prepare these students for their exams and clinical rotations. The text is also designed to prepare international students for United States residency programs. Non-medical persons interested in learning more about the basics of psychiatry and behavioral and social factors affecting health will find this volume compelling.
