	<P><p>Rising housing costs put secure and decent housing in central urban neighborhoods in peril. How do civil society organizations (CSOs) effectively demand accountability from the state to address the needs of low-income residents? In her groundbreaking book, <i>Democratizing Urban Development, </i>Maureen Donaghy charts the constraints and potential opportunities facing these community organizations. She assesses the various strategies CSOs engage to influence officials and ensure access to affordable housing through policies, programs, and institutions. <br><br> <i>Democratizing Urban Development</i> presents efforts by CSOs in four cities across the hemispheric divide: Rio de Janeiro, S&atilde;o Paulo, Washington, DC, and Atlanta. Donaghy studies the impact and outcomes that ensue from these efforts, noting that CSOs must sometimes shift their own ideology or adapt to the political environment in which they operate to ensure access to housing and support the goals of an inclusive city.<br>

			<p><i>"Throughout the world, big cities are struggling to provide housing for their growing populations. Accommodation issues are particularly acute for members of lower-income groups, who are increasingly being challenged by gentrification and real estate development. In her pioneering comparative study, </i>Democratizing Urban Development <i>, Maureen Donaghy deftly tells the story of how local communities and their supporting organizations in four cities&#8212;two in Brazil, two in the United States&#8212;push against the prevailing tendencies of marginalization and polarization. The unusual compilation of cases from both developed and transitional cities yields some exceptional nuggets of insight into a problem that, in many respects, appears to be virtually intractable."</i><br>&#8212;<b>Richard Stren</b>, Professor Emeritus of Political Science and Senior Fellow, Global Cities Institute at the University of Toronto, and co-editor of <i>Cities Transformed: Demographic Change and Its Implications in the Developing World</i><br>
