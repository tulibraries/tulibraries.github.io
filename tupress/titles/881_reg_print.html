</P></td></tr></table><BR><P><p>Social influence is at the heart of many pressing societal issues-promotion of healthful lifestyles, the raising of environmental consciousness, the effects of censorship, "image-processing" in politics, and ultrasophisticated advertising and marketing. With lively examples from current events and popular culture, this book pulls together a wide range of research and theory about the psychology of attitudes, persuasion, and social influence. 

<p>Philip Zimbardo and Michael R. Leippe cover all the major topics in this area. To integrate the vast amount of material they use the recurring theme of "attitude systems," in which attitudes, cognitions, behaviors, and intentions can be affected by external agents of influence as well as influenced internally by each other. 

<p>Stressing the personal and cultural relevance of social influence principles, Zimbardo and Leippe use social and geopolitical events and issues to illustrate the concepts and offer stories and anecdotes as examples of how these principles work in day-to-day situations. In addition, two applications chapters focus on influence in the legal system and on improving the quality of life (the environment, personal health, and mental well-being).</p>
