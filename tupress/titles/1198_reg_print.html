<P><p>Much of the White Sox history is underscored by its sometimes grim tug-of-war with the Cubs for the loyalties of Chicago fans. Even though the Sox earned bragging rights by soundly thrashing their cross-town rivals in a celebrated World Series, the annual post-season City Series, and any number of charity games that followed, the White Sox emerged as the classic underdog following the epochal Black Sox Scandal of 1920. The conspiracy to throw the 1919 World Series was a defining moment in baseball&#151and for the fortunes of the beloved Chicago institution in the coming decades.

<p><i>The White Sox Encyclopedia</i> is a comprehensive history of one of the more controversial teams in the American league&#151the trials, tribulations and moments of glory of a ballclub interwoven into the fabric of the South Side Irish community that supported it through years of crowning glory, the disgrace of the devastating scandal, and the long, losing seasons that were to follow.

<p>This book brings together, for the first time, 10 decades of baseball on the South Side and will be a wealth of information for White Sox fans, sports mavens, and trivia buffs alike. It includes:
<ul><li><p>700 illustrations, including a 16-page color section
<li><p>complete statistics through the 1996 season on hitting streaks and ERA's, box scores, trades, an all-time roster of managers, players and position leaders
<li><p>season-by-season descriptions
<li><p>game highlights
<li><p>over 100 player profiles from Tommie Agee to Richie Zisk and all the great stars past and present
<li><p>the managerial strategies, the personalities, honors, and the milestones
<li><p>descriptions of unforgettable moments and memories
<li><p>The City Series, by Alex Williams
<li><p>an immense treasure trove of little-known facts and surprising anecdotes</ul></p>

</p><p>The purpose of <i>Baseball Encyclopedias of North America</I>, edited by Rich Westcott, is to examine each of the clubs in big league baseball in an encyclopedic format.  That is, to provide baseball fans a place to go to find information on a particular team organized in such a fashion that is available nowhere else.  The series editor aims to concentrate on the 16 original teams of both leagues and publish each book as he is able to find the right person to do it.  The books will all be unique because of their emphasis on three major components: 1) short, straight forward prose accounts of all aspects of the team including seasons, players, stadiums and front office people, 2) listings and statistics of all players of the team, and 3) heavy illustrations.  These books can be read cover to cover or used as reference materials.</p>
