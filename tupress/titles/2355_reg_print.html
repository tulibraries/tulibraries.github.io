Paul Djupe has recruited top scholars in the discipline, and he and his contributors provide original, rigorous research that nicely complements the religion literature on clergy, public opinion, and social psychology. It brings the scholarly treatment of tolerance up to date, addresses key debates, and provides important coverage. </I>Religion and Political Tolerance in America<I> makes a significant contribution to the literature."</i><br>&#151<b>Elizabeth A. Oldmixon</b>, Associate Professor of Political Science at the University of North Texas</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><P>Religious institutions are often engaged in influencing the beliefs and values that individuals hold. But religious groups can also challenge how people think about democracy, including the extension of equal rights and liberties regardless of viewpoint, or what is commonly called political tolerance. 

<P>The essays in <I>Religion and Political Tolerance in America</I> seek to understand how these elements interrelate. The editor and contributors to this important volume present new and innovative research that wrestles with the fundamental question of the place of religion in democratic society. They address topics ranging from religious contributions to social identity to the political tolerance that religious elites (clergy) hold and advocate to others, and how religion shapes responses to intolerance.

<P>The conclusion, by Ted Jelen, emphasizes that religion�s take on political tolerance is nuanced and that they are not incompatible; religion can sometimes enhance the tolerance of ordinary citizens.

<p><i>"(T)he volume is an important compendium of empirical investigations into how religious phenomena affect one's tolerance of unpopular groups.... Perhaps its most important contribution lies in the authors' use of multiple measures of religion and tolerance and how they weigh these measures' merits in adequately capturing religion-tolerance relationships."<br/></i>&#8212;<b><i>Review of Religious Research</i></b><br>

<p><i>"Djupe's collection...examin(es) political tolerance&#8212;and religion's influence on it&#8212;as an empirical question. Indeed, it does a valuable job of outlining a tradition of quantitative political tolerance analysis that stretches back to the 1950s and of exhibiting recent methodological innovations.... (I)t is a wonderful illustration of the creative use of quantitative methods to unpick long-held assumptions as well as of the profound challenges that quantitative researchers face when mapping out perceptual change."<br/> </i>&#8212;<b><i>Journal of Contemporary Religion</i></b><br>

</p><p>The <i>Social Logic of Politics Series</i>, edited by Scott D. McClurg (formerly edited by Alan S. Zuckerman), directs attention to several related clusters of research in the social sciences. At the core is a theoretical principle: individuals make political decisions, like other choices, by taking into account cues from other persons. Studies move from individuals to groups to large scale collectivities. Usually examining micro-politics-voting and other forms of political participation; the place of politics in households, the family, the friendship unit, and the neighborhood- this research also studies how broader political and social contexts influence and are influenced by these micro-processes. It includes as well "small group behavior" in political institutions, such as exchanges of cues in legislatures and patron-client relations in bureaucratic agencies and political parties. Books in The Social Logic of Politics Series will apply research techniques that run the gamut of contemporary political science, sociology, communications, and geography.</p>
