Instead, Paula Massood demonstrates how the urban has functioned as a central organizing trope in the articulation of Black culture, progress, protest and subjectivity.  Massood provides a much-needed innovative framework for understanding the complex development of African American film culture."</I>
<br>&#151<b>Jacqueline Stewart</b>, Assistant Professor English, Cinema & Media Studies, African & African American Studies, University of Chicago and author of the forthcoming book, <I>Migrating to the Movies: Cinema and Black Urban Modernity</I><I></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><p>In <I>Black City Cinema</I>, Paula Massood shows how popular films reflected the massive social changes that resulted from the Great Migration of African Americans from the rural South to cities in the North, West, and Mid-West during the first three decades of the twentieth century. By the onset of the Depression, the Black population had become primarily urban, transforming individual lives as well as urban experience and culture.

<p>Massood probes into the relationship of place and time, showing how urban settings became an intrinsic element of African American film as Black people became more firmly rooted in urban spaces and more visible as historical and political subjects. Illuminating the intersections of film, history, politics, and urban discourse, she considers the chief genres of African American and Hollywood narrative film: the black cast musicals of the 1920s and the "race" films of the early sound era to blaxploitation and hood films, as well as the work of Spike Lee toward the end of the century.  As it examines such a wide range of films over much of the twentieth century, this book offers a unique map of Black representations in film.</p>

<BR><H2 class="inpageheading">Reviews</h2><p>
<p><I>"Massood's interpretive discussions of the films are clearly written and convincing; she makes an important original point about the ending of </I>Do the Right Thing<I>, probably the most discussed African American film&#151and ending&#151of all time. She illuminates many other films, about which she writes with easy familiarity and complete authority."</I>
<br>&#151<b>J. Ronald Green</b>, Professor, History of Art/Film Studies, Ohio State University and author of <I>Straight Lick: The Cinema of Oscar Micheaux</I>

</p><p>The <I>Culture and the Moving Image</I> series, edited by Robert Sklar, seeks to publish innovative scholarship and criticism on cinema, television, and the culture of the moving image.  The series will emphasize works that view these media in their broad cultural and social frameworks.  Its themes will include a global perspective on the world-wide production of images; the links between film, television, and video art; a concern with issues of race, class, and gender; and an engagement with the growing convergence of history and theory in moving image studies.</p>
