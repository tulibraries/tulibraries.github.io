</P><BLOCKQUOTE><I>"</I>Teaching Marianne and Uncle Sam<I> is a well-written, well-researched, and fascinating book that offers an original take on teacher mobilization in France and the United States. The book also compellingly deals with broader theoretical issues, such as the impact of political centralization on social mobilization and the role of selective engagement in labor politics. Teachers and union representatives will find this book informative, as will historians, sociologists, and political scientists interested in education policy and politics. </I>Teaching Marianne and Uncle Sam<I> makes a direct and welcome contribution to the fields of education and labor studies, as well as to comparative, historical, and political social science analysis."</I><br>&#151<b>Daniel B&#233;land</b>, Canada Research Chair in Public Policy at the Johnson-Shoyama Graduate School of Public Policy (University of Saskatchewan campus)</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Offering the first systematic, comparative examination of the origins of teachers' unions in two countries&#8212;France and the United States&#8212;<i>Teaching Marianne and Uncle Sam</i> shows how teachers' unions came into existence not because of the willful efforts of particular actors, but over the course of decades of conflict over the proper role of professional educators in public politics.

<P>Nicholas Toloudis traces teacher unionism back to the first efforts of governments to centralize public education. He carefully documents how centralization created new understandings of the role of teachers in their societies and generated new sources of conflict within teachers' corps. Using rare archival source materials, Toloudis illustrates how these internal conflicts became salient in teachers' battles with governments over their legitimate right to exist as collective claim-makers within the polity.

<BR>&nbsp;<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p><i>"Toloudis deals with the origins of teachers unions in France and the US in the late-19th and early- and middle-20th centuries. The book has some valuable historical information about teachers unions and politics in the two nations, and utilizes some interesting archival material that should be of interest to historians of education generally and of teachers unions in particular.... Summing Up: Recommended."</i><br>&#151<b><i>Choice</i></b>

<p><i>"Nicholas Toloudis makes a compelling argument in this engaging book.... The ambition of </i>Teaching Marianne and Uncle Sam<i> is to bring two national cases together to unpack causal relations between the key variables of centralization, mobilization and selective engagement. Comparative studies of political development between the U.S. and other countries is rarer than it should be in political science, and Toloudis�s empirical study is welcome in this regard, especially given the intellectual weight of de Tocqueville�s </i>Democracy in America<i>, whose insights are echoed throughout the book. The richest payoff of the comparison is to show how political centralization intersects with the formation of collective political identities, and how timing can structure the kinds of mobilization and political strategies that collective actors employ.... [T]his book is a valuable contribution to comparative studies of political development, and its focus on a policy field that has been insufficiently researched in political science makes it worthwhile read."</i> <br>&#151<b><i>Perspectives on Politics</i></b>
