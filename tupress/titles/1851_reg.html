Finally, for every resident and visitor to the region, a comprehensive guide to the gardens of eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey, and northern Delaware.  Magnificently illustrated with nearly 200 full color photographs, <i>A Guide to the Great Gardens of the Philadelphia Region</i> provides essential information on how to locate and enjoy the finest gardens the area has to offer.

As the horticultural epicenter of the United States, Philadelphia and the surrounding towns, suburbs, and countryside are blessed with more public gardens in a concentrated area than almost any other region in the world. Stretching from Trenton, New Jersey through Philadelphia and down to Newark, Delaware, this area (often called the Delaware Valley) offers more horticultural riches than a visitor can possibly see even in a couple of weeks of hectic garden hopping. 
<p>
In <i>A Guide to the Great Gardens of the Philadelphia Region</i> you will find:
<p>
- detailed coverage of almost 100 gardens;<p>
- maps to indicate where area gardens are in relation to each other to plan day trip itineraries;<p>
- key information about each major garden, including hours, fees, time needed for a tour, history, acreage, and special features;<p>
- over a dozen gardens that have never before been featured in any garden guidebook;<p>
- arranged by interest, to help guide readers to gardens that will most meet their needs;<p>
- notations about historical houses, cafes/restaurants, gift shops, and children's features at each major garden
