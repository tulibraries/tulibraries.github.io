</P><BLOCKQUOTE><I>"The editors have cagily combined groundbreaking scholarship on literary texts that no one knows about, with useful, historically grounded criticism of literary texts that established scholars and those interested in learning about Asian American literature are likely to study. The prose is lucid and accessible, the readings are conversant both with Asian American and American cultural history and with relevant Asian American literary scholarship, and therefore the book should be useful not only to scholars but to teachers and students, as the editors indicate was their goal."</i>

<p><i>Recovered Legacies: Authority and Identity in Early Asian American Literature</i> employs contemporary and traditional readings of representative works in prose, poetry, and drama to suggest new ways of understanding and appreciating the critically fertile but underexamined body of Asian American writing from the late 1800s to the early 1960s. The essays in this volume engage this corpus&#151composed of multiple genres from different periods and by authors of different ethnicities&#151with a strong awareness of historical context and a keen sensitivity to literary form. As a collection, <i>Recovered Legacies</i> re-establishes the rich and diverse literary heritage of Asian America and argues persuasively for the significance of these works to the American literary canon.

<BR>&nbsp;<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p><i>"...much-needed... This critical collection is particularly rewarding for its historical focus. Recommended."</i>
<br>&#151<b><i>Choice</i></b>

<p><i>"</i>Recovered Legacies<i> is a noteworthy, thought-provoking, insightful and informative book on the history and impact of pioneering Asian American literature."</i>
<br>&#151;<b><i>Korean Quarterly</i></b>

<p><i>"[T]his collection represents a useful contribution to existing Asian American literary scholarship. The literary archive this collection furnishes is an important one…[T]he Asian American literary field would do well to pay attention to the arguments posited in this collection’s introduction."</i>
<br>&#151<b><i>American Studies</i></b>

<p><i>"[An] important volume…cover[ing] the most important writers, genres, themes and issues that we consider necessary for an overview of pioneering Asian American writing….Recovered Legacies bravely goes against the grain of current Asian American scholarship providing the reader with lucid and invaluable tools with which to read texts of the past and rethink the ways we might unwittingly impose our own prejudices on literary works. By engaging the texts that formed and continue to influence the Asian American cannon, the essays help us rethink the ways we read and teach this literature in evolving contexts."</i>

</p><p>Founded by Sucheng Chan in 1991, the <I>Asian American History and Culture</I>, series has sponsored innovative scholarship that has redefined, expanded, and advanced the field of Asian American studies while strengthening its links to related areas of scholarly inquiry and engaged critique. Like the field from which it emerged, the series remains rooted in the social sciences and humanities, encompassing multiple regions, formations, communities, and identities. Extending the vision of founding editor Sucheng Chan and emeriti editor Michael Omi and David Palumbo-Liu, series editors K. Scott Wong, Linda Trinh Võ, and Cathy Schlund-Vials continue to develop a foundational collection that embodies a range of theoretical and methodological approaches to Asian American studies.</p>
