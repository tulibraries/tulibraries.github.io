<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>"</i>Yellow Light<I> is an impressive undertaking that deserves recognition as an introduction to contemporary Asian American arts, and more importantly, as an exploration of the diversity of that community.... [It] is a testament to the Asian American creative spirit and another step toward a new understanding of contemporary art."</I>
<br>&#151<b><I>MultiCultural Review</I></b><I></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Amy Ling brings together in one comprehensive volume poets, novelists, dramatists, musicians, songwriters, composers, filmmakers, choreographers, and performance artists who span three generations and represent the broad spectrum of ethnicities that make up Asian America. They share thoughts on their work, their audiences, and their relationship to the Asian American rubric and American life and culture. They provide a rare glimpse of the inspirations and aspirations out of which their energy and ideas grow and place their work, each differently, in the complex fabric of American life. An indispensible anthology of work and an inspiring and provocative cultural record, <I>Yellow Light</I> casts a revealing glow on the contradictions, influences, imagination, and humanity expressed through the vastly varied creative projects of Americans with Asian roots. </P>
<P>This book will engage readers interested in Asian American literature, film, and culture and students and scholars of Asian American studies, American culture, and multicultural studies. </P>

<p><i>What is Asian America?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a place?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a race?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a frame of reference?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a government-imposed expedient?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a box to check on a form?
<br>It's a dream in the heart
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Bulosan's claim,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a tug in the gut,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a gleam of recognition:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asian ancestry
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;American struggle.</i>

Scott Wong, Linda Trinh Võ, and Cathy Schlund-Vials.
</p><p>Founded by Sucheng Chan in 1991, the <I>Asian American History and Culture</I>, series has sponsored innovative scholarship that has redefined, expanded, and advanced the field of Asian American studies while strengthening its links to related areas of scholarly inquiry and engaged critique. Like the field from which it emerged, the series remains rooted in the social sciences and humanities, encompassing multiple regions, formations, communities, and identities. Extending the vision of founding editor Sucheng Chan and emeriti editor Michael Omi and David Palumbo-Liu, series editors K. Scott Wong, Linda Trinh Võ, and Cathy Schlund-Vials continue to develop a foundational collection that embodies a range of theoretical and methodological approaches to Asian American studies.</p>
