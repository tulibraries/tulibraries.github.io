<BLOCKQUOTE><p><i>"</i>Transformations of Warfare in the Contemporary World<i>&nbsp;addresses 'new forms of war' from a sociological perspective. It does not try to present some gazetteer of the military future; rather, the editors and contributors discuss the implications of some obvious trends. The chapters are outstanding and thought provoking, getting precisely at the critical issues facing 'core militaries,' recent events in Iraq, biometrics, and heroism and its link to the commemoration literature. There is no question that the issues are relevant and important, and the editors and contributions have exactly the type of skill and intellectual curiosity needed for this work."</i><br>&#8212;<b>Miguel A. Centeno,</b><b><i> </i></b>Musgrave Professor of Sociology and International Affairs at Princeton University and co-author of&nbsp;<em>Global Capitalism: A Sociological Perspective</em><br /><br></BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Today's warfare has moved away from being an event between massed national populations and toward small numbers of combatants using high-tech weaponry. The editors of and contributors to the timely collection <i>Transformations of Warfare in the Contemporary World </i>show that this shift reflects changes in the technological, strategic, ideological, and ethical realms.<br>
<p>The essays in this volume discuss
<br />&middot;&#9;the waning connection between citizenship and soldiering; 
<br />&middot;&#9;the shift toward more reconstructive than destructive activities by militaries; 
<br />&middot;&#9;the ethics of irregular or asymmetrical warfare; 
<br />&middot;&#9;the role of novel techniques of identification in military settings; 
<br />&middot;&#9;the stress on precision associated with targeted killings and kidnappings; 
<br />&middot;&#9;the uses of the social sciences in contemporary warfare. <br>
<p>In his concluding remarks, David Jacobson explores the extent to which the contemporary transformation of warfare is a product of a shift in the character of the combatants themselves.

"Transformations of Warfare in the Contemporary World&nbsp;<i>provides a fresh account of some of the recent developments in warfare. The editors and contributors help elucidate some of the trends and changes in modern warfare; this puts the new developments into a social, political, and cultural context. The book's strength lies in the fact that the contributors engage with the developments in modern warfare yet have that reflexive capacity to see some of the problematic sides. This collection fills a real gap in the literature."</i><br>&#8212;<b>Andreas Hess</b>, Senior Lecturer of Sociology at University College Dublin and&nbsp;author of<i> The Political Theory of Judith N. Shklar: Exile from Exile<br /></i>
