<br>&#151;<b>Franklin Foer</b>, author of <i>How Soccer Explains the World: An Unlikely Theory of Globalization</i><i></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><p>In <i>The Bottom Line</i>, one of the foremost sports economists writing today, Andrew Zimbalist (<i>National Pastime</i>), analyzes the "net value" of sports. He examines motives for why owners buy franchises, the worth of the players and the profitability of teams, and the importance of publicly funded stadiums. In the essays collected here&#151;which appeared in publications like <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>Sports Business Journal</i>, and <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> from 1998-2006&#151;Zimbalist considers the current state of organized sports, from football and baseball to basketball, hockey, and soccer. He also addresses antitrust and labor relations issues, gender equity concerns, collegiate athletics, and the regulation of steroid use, providing readers with a better understanding of the business of sports and the sports business&#151;and what makes both tick.</p>

<BR><H2 class="inpageheading">Reviews</h2><p>
<p><i>"Andrew Zimbalist has taken important topics and given us a thoughtful, fascinating, and deeply prepared discussion of the games we hold so dear."</i>
<br>&#151;<b>Lesley Visser</b>, CBS Sportscaster

<p><i>"Andrew Zimbalist is one of the best writers among economists working today, and he provides insightful analysis on interesting subjects. The essays in </i>The Bottom Line<i> provide a narrative history of recent events in the sports business and contain a wealth of detailed information, such as the share price for the Indian's IPO. I recommend this unique book."</i>
<br>&#151;<b>Brad Humphreys</b>, Associate Professor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign 

<p><i>"</i>The Bottom Line<i> is not only eminently readable but it has much to teach the average (whatever such a designation might mean) sports fan a great deal about the economics of sport. It contains information that is valuable and just beyond the access of the average fan."</i>
<br>&#151;<b>Grant Farred</b>, author of <i>Phantom Calls: Race and the Globalization of the NBA</i> and <i>Long Distance Love: A Passion for Football</i>

<p><i>"The advantage of this book is that it allows the reader to see how one of the foremost professors in sports and business analyzed each event virtually as it happened. So this book will take you back over the past decade and consistently teach you something new about professional and college sports."</i>
<br>&#151;<b>Dave Berri</b>, <a href="http://dberri.wordpress.com/2006/09/29/the-bottom-line-a-book-review/" target="new">The Wages of Wins Journal</a>

<p><i>"The bottom line on </i>The Bottom Line<i>? Definitely worth the money and time, even though it reprints work previously published. The author of several excellent books on baseball economics, Zimbalist (economics, Smith College) is an indefatigable, seemingly ubiquitous commentator on the business of sports in the print and broadcast media....Readers will be informed by most of these opinion pieces and infuriated by others. But Zimbalist should not be ignored. Highly recommended."</i>
<br>&#151<b><i>Choice</i></b>

<p><i>"</i>The Bottom Line<i> brings together some of the best articles that [Zimbalist] has written during the past 15 years. Like readers who find that their favorite novelist is also an expert short-story writer, those familiar with Zimbalist�s books but not his op-ed pieces will see the same trenchant analysis and quick with in these essays�.It is a collection worth reading and rereading."</i>
<br>&#151<b><i>The Journal of Sports Economics</i></b>

<p><i>"Andrew Zimbalist pulls no punches, writing in a deliberately provocative style that will no doubt have some cheering with every jab and upper cut and others screaming about blows below the belt�. [T]he articles provide an efficient, accessible and at the time they were written, timely survey of much of the Sports Economics landscape as viewed by Professor Zimbalist�.[He] provides a quick comprehensive overview of the subject."</i>
