        <p>"Barriers and Belonging <em>covers a wide range of topics yet remains coherent as a collection.  It touches on many of the important discussions currently animating the field and includes topics rarely discussed in disability studies, such as the experiences of people in rural settings and the role of religious faith in people's lives. This book will shift students' understandings of disability, catalyze disability organizing on campus, and re-orient pedagogy and curricula."<br>

        <p></BLOCKQUOTE><P><p>What is the direct impact that disability studies has on the lives of disabled people today?  The editors and contributors to the essential anthology, <i>Barriers and Belonging</i>, provide thirty-seven personal narratives that explore what it means to live with disability and why the field of disability studies matters. Every chapter includes key terms, discussion questions, and suggestions for further reading.<br/><br/> <i>Barriers and Belonging</i> explores how disability informs self-knowledge, interpersonal and community relationships, and political commitments. Contributors offer experiential insight into living with an array of disabilities, from spinal cord injuries, blindness, deafness, and autism to psychiatric diagnoses, learning disabilities, and chronic pain. Several essays articulate activist and pride orientations toward disability, demonstrating the importance of understanding disability as a multi-dimensional process&#8212;as personal, relational and socio-political.<br><P CLASS="top"><A HREF="#top">BACK TO TOP</A></P></p><P><h2  class="inpageheading"><A NAME="excerpt"></a>Excerpt</h2><p><A HREF="http://www.temple.edu/tempress/chapters_2400/2416_ch1.pdf">Read the Introduction (pdf).</a><br><P CLASS="top"><A HREF="#top">BACK TO TOP</A></P></P><P><h2  class="inpageheading"><A NAME="reviews"></a>Reviews</h2>
        <p>"Barriers and Belonging <em>is a hugely important volume&#8212;the first of its kind. As an original book that involves a synthesis of literatures and arguments, it offers an incredible range of diversity, experiences, and voices. One of its greatest strengths is how truly student-friendly it is. The focus on personal experience is notable, and the contributors explore many facets of the overall disability experience. I am very excited about the possibilities for this volume!"<br>

        <p><i>"A common thread of many of the (contributors') essays is how their personal experiences with disability in college led them to accept a disability identity and ultimately into activism.... (E)ach section of the book has worked to include a wide representation of disability.... The purpose of the book (is) as a teaching tool.... It allows readers to see the progression of thought by which someone might move from little understanding or from an insecurity about their own disability, into a role in which advocacy&#8212;either through action or academics&#8212;might become a central part of their lives...each of these essays is well worth reading.</i><i>"<br/></i>&#8212;<b><i>Wordgathering</i></b><br><p>"Barriers and Belonging <i>is much more than a textbook: it's an eye-opening collection of lives, told with honesty and moving candor. The narratives, which are organized into sections around themes such as communication, family and relationships, are engaging and short, allowing room for many different points of view.... The writers lead us up to the moment their conception of their disability changes in some way. The ways are as varied as the disabilities themselves, which range from acquired conditions such as PTSD and chronic pain, to congenital conditions such as cerebral palsy and Down Syndrome, to mental health and cognitive conditions."<br/></i>&#8212;<b><i>intima: a journal of narrative medicine</i></b><br><p>"<i>This book is a meaningful contribution to the body of materials for courses that address individual and group differences. The text could be an excellent complement to other course materials in a survey or introductory level course. Its style of personal narratives will appeal to students because they are brief.... These narratives are also intensely honest and personal. For those who have never considered the impact of non-visible disabilities, this text is an eye opener. After reading this volume, it is unlikely that readers would ever respond to another person with the casual saying, </i>but you don't have a disability<i>. As a resource for courses in disability studies or human diversity, </i>Barriers and Belonging <i> presents a fresh perspective."<br/></i>&#8212;<b>Teachers College Record</b><br><P CLASS="top"><A HREF="#top">BACK TO TOP</A></P></b></p><p><h2 class="inpageheading"><A NAME="contents"></a>Contents</h2><P><span style="font-family: 'Verdana';font-size: 13px;" >Acknowledgments&#8199;<br/>Introduction: Entering the Field / Michelle Jarman and Leila Monaghan<br/><br/></span><span style="font-family: 'Verdana';font-size: 13px;font-weight: bold;" >PART I  LAYING THE GROUNDWORK<br/></span><span style="font-family: 'Verdana';font-size: 13px;" >I.1.
