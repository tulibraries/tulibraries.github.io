</P><p>Today's executive in human services must be concerned with efficiency.  Pressure to develop greater managerial and financial expertise threatens the professional's primary commitment to people and their problems.  This book is especially useful because it deals with ideological and technological issues simultaneously.  Thirteen original essays reflect the active involvement of the editors and contributors in teaching, direct practice, research, or supervision.

<p>The book is divided into four parts.  The first provides needed theoretical underpinnings through an essay on social administration by Simon Slavin and another on relevant organizational theory by Burton Gummer.  Policy issues, functioning within various constraints, and the leader's role in working with boards of governors and advisors are then examined in articles by Felice Perlmutter, Willard C. Richan, Seymour J. Rosenthal, and James E. Young.  Technical areas such as financial management, communications, and project development and evaluation are presented within a systems framework in essays by Scott Muir Wilson, Roger A. Lohmann, Thomas W. Weirich, Albert E. Wilkerson, and Larry Hirschhorn.  The concluding section on human resources provides essays by Leslie B. Alexander, Toba Schwaber Kerson, Ione D. Vargus, and Harvey Weiner that deal with the need to recruit women administrators, the problems faced by minority executives, and the morale-building potential of professional training programs.
