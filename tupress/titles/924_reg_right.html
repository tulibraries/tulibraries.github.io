<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>"As engineers undertake to mobilize people and resources to effect change, they will encounter a growing need to understand the social values that drive their decisions as well as the ethical consequences of those decisions.  Books like </I>The Ethical Engineer<I> can greatly assist in this process.  </I>The Ethical Engineer<I> is a good book at the right time."</I>
<br>&#151<b>Frederick C. Nelson</b>, Dean of Engineering, Tufts University<I></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>On occasion, professionals need to use moral reasoning as well as engineering skills to function effectively in their occupation.  Eugene Schlossberger has created a practical guide to ethical decision-making for engineers, students, and workers in business and industry.

<p><I>The Ethical Engineer</I> sets out the tools and materials essential to dealing with whistle-blowing, environmental and safety concerns, bidding, confidentiality, conflict of interest, sales ethics, advertising, employer-employee relations, when to fight a battle, and when to break the rules.

<p>The author offers recommendations and techniques as well as rules, principles, and values that can guide the reader.  Lively examples, engaging anecdotes, witty comments, and well-reasoned analysis prove his conviction that "ethics is good business."

<P><p><I>"</I>The Ethical Engineer<I> is likely to make a very important contribution to the ethical development and eventually, the ethical practice, of the next generation of American engineers.  It is an important, useful, and well-executed text.  One outstanding feature is that its discussions are well targeted to help students care about ethics and the significance ethics has for their lives.  The coverage is excellent: relevant cases and issues from the business ethics literature are nicely integrated into the text."</I>
