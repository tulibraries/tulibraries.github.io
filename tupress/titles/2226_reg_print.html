</P></td></tr></table><BR><P><P><i>Espejos y ventanas</i> details the individual stories of the Mexican community of Kennett Square, a community of three generations who have migrated to work in the world's largest mushroom industry, and details their personal and political aspirations. Published with both Spanish and English versions, these oral histories provide a window into the lives of retirees who came north twenty-five years ago; of mothers and children who stayed in Mexico and finally made it over; of teenagers building a house for their family in Mexico; of children graduating from college, their feet planted in two worlds. In doing so, it provides a window into the general struggles of immigrant populations for social, political, and economic rights.
