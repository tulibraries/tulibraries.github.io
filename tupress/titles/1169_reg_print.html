<P><p>This tightly edited volume contains the finest, highly accessible articles in the fast-growing legal genre of critical race theory&#151a field which is changing the way this nation looks at race, challenging orthodoxy, questioning the premises of liberalism, and debating sacred wisdoms. Including treatments of two new, exciting topics&#151Critical Race Feminism and Critical White Studies&#151this volume is truly on "the cutting edge." Questions for discussion and reading suggestions after each part make this volume essential for those interested in law, the multiculturalism movement, political science, and critical thought.

<P>In this wide-ranging second edition, Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic bring together the finest, most illustrative, and highly accessible articles in the fast-growing legal genre of Critical Race Theory. In challenging orthodoxy, questioning the premises of liberalism, and debating sacred wisdoms, Critical Race Theory scholars writing over the past few years have indelibly changed the way America looks at race.

<P>This edition contains treatment of all the topics covered in the first edition, along with provocative and probing questions for discussion and detailed suggestions for additional reading, all of which set this fine volume apart from the field.  In addition, this edition contains five new substantive units&#151crime, critical race practice, intergroup tensions and alliances, gay/lesbian issues, and transcending the black-white binary paradigm of race.  In each of these areas, groundbreaking scholarship by the movement's founding figures as well as the brightest new stars provides immediate entry to current trends and developments in critical civil rights thought.</p>

<p><i>"...a rich trove of articles for readers who wish to delve into this important new field of inquiry."</i>
<br>&#151<b><i>Journal of American Ethnic History</i></b>

<p><i>"</i>Critical Race Theory<i> tackles numerous issues by presenting several related essays within themed sections.... The material is sometimes dense, confrontational, rhetorical, and demanding.... But it is must-read material. The book raises more questions than answers, and that's fine. It forces us to face uncomfortable issues and think hard about our legal system and our place in it."</i>
