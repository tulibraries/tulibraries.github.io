<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>"This far-ranging and well-documented book explores race, class and gender as systems of oppression against women of color in the United States....[A]n important addition to the literature of women's studies."</I>
<br>&#151<b><I>Publishers Weekly</I></b><I></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>The theme of race, class, and gender as interlocking systems of oppression unites these original essays about the experience of women of color&#151African Americans, Latinas, Native Americans, and Asian Americans.  The contributing scholars discuss the social conditions that simultaneously oppress women of color and provide sites for opposition.

<p>Though diverse in their focus, the essays uncover similar experiences in the classroom, workplace, family, prison, and other settings.  Working-class women, poor women, and professional women alike experience subordination, restricted participation in social institutions, and structural placement in roles with limited opportunities.

<p>How do women survive, resist, and cope with these oppressive structures?  Many articles tell how women of color draw upon resources from their culture, family, kin, and community.  Others document defenses against cultural assaults by the dominant society&#151Native American mothers instilling tribal heritage in their children; African American women engaging in community work; and Asian American women opposing the patriarchy of their own communities and the stereotypes imposed by society at large.

<p>These essays challenge some of our basic assumptions about society, revealing that experiences of inequality are not only diverse but relational.

<P><p><I>"[T]his collection should be welcomed by all those concerned with issues of race, gender, and class in American society.  It presents a wealth of information, data, and analysis in direct, refreshingly jargon-free language, and would make an excellent text for undergraduate courses in sociology, women's studies, and ethnic studies."</I>

<p><I>"This book will be extremely important in the growing literature that examines the intersections of race, class, and gender stratification....  The list of contributors includes some of the most significant writers working in this field."</I>
<br>&#151<b>Margaret L. Anderson</b>, University of Delaware

<p><I>"A volume like this is badly needed in women's studies and ethnic studies because the emphasis...has been on...white women and racial-ethnic men, respectively.  The book's greatest importance lies in its political significance.  It has the potential of forcing modification of many assumptions on which contemporary feminism is based.  And the more such theories emanate from and are applicable to the lives of diverse American women, the ore profound and useful they will be."</I>
