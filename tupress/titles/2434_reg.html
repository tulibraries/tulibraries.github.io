But this shortcut can exact a fatal cost on talented athletes. In his urgent book <i>Suicide Squeeze</i>, William Kashatus chronicles the experiences of Taylor Hooton and Rob Garibaldi, two promising high school baseball players who abused APEDs in the hopes of attracting professional scouts and Division I recruiters. However, as a result of their steroid abuse, they ended up taking their own lives.<br><p>In <i>Suicide Squeeze</i>-named for the high-risk play in baseball to steal home-Kashatus identifies the symptoms and dangers of steroid use among teens. Using archival research and interviews with the Hooton and Garibaldi families, he explores the lives and deaths of these two troubled young men, the impact of their suicides on Major League Baseball, and the ongoing fight against adolescent APED use that their parents have been waging.<br><p>A passionate appeal to prevent additional senseless deaths by athletes, <i>Suicide Squeeze</i> makes an important contribution to debates on youth and sports and on public policy.<br><P CLASS="top"><A HREF="#top">BACK TO TOP</A></P>&nbsp;<h2  class="inpageheading"><A NAME="excerpt"></a>Excerpt</h2><p><A HREF="http://www.temple.edu/tempress/chapters_2400/2434_ch1.pdf"><p>Read Chapter 1 (pdf). </A><br><P CLASS="top"><A HREF="#top">BACK TO TOP</A></P><BR>&nbsp;<h2  class="inpageheading"><A NAME="reviews"></a>Reviews</h2><p>"<i>The 2005 Congressional Hearing on Steroids in Baseball was the catalyst for Major League Baseball to implement the nation's toughest drug-testing program in professional sports. But what captured my attention most were the moving testimonies of Don Hooton and Denise Garibaldi, parents of sons who had turned to anabolic steroid use to achieve their ambitions as baseball players. William Kashatus's integration of the tragic stories of Taylor Hooton and Rob Garibaldi with the most recent research on appearance- and performance-enhancing drugs appeals to both our hearts and our minds. </i>Suicide Squeeze<i> is a timely and important book for parents, coaches, teachers, and everyone who cares about our nation's youth.</i>"-<b>George J. Mitchell</b>, U.S. Senator from Maine, 1980-1995, and author of <i>Report to the Commissioner of Baseball of an Independent Investigation into the Illegal Use of Steroids and Other Performance Enhancing Substances by Players in Major League Baseball</i><br><p><i>"</i>Suicide Squeeze<i> tells the compelling stories of Taylor Hooton and Rob Garibaldi-not only the tragic circumstances surrounding their deaths but also how they inspired Major League Baseball to join the fight against the use of steroids and other performance-enhancing substances among our youth. Together with the Hooton and Garibaldi families, Bill Kashatus has succeeded in putting a human face on this pressing national health issue.</i>"-<b>Allan H. "Bud" Selig</b>, Commissioner of Baseball, 1992-2015<br><p><i>"</i>Suicide Squeeze<i> is a chilling account of undetected teenage steroid abuse that subjected two families to the greatest pain and horror any parent can imagine.
