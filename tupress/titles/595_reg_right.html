<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>"An especially timely book in its constant emphasis on the deep connection between the ethical/political and the metaphysical/epistemological spheres of philosophy and indeed 'real life.'"</I>
<br>&#151<b><I>Radical Philosophy Review of Books</I></b><I></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>This collection of essays by American philosopher Alain Locke (1885-1954) makes readily available for the first time his important writings on cultural pluralism, value relativism, and critical relativism. As a black philosopher early in this century, Locke was a pioneer: having earned both undergraduate and doctoral degrees at Harvard, he was a Rhodes scholar at Oxford, studied at the University of Berlin, and chaired the Philosophy Department at Howard University for almost four decades. He was perhaps best known as a leading figure in the Harlem Renaissance.

<p>Locke�s works in philosophy&#151many previously unpublished&#151conceptually frame the Harlem Renaissance and New Negro movement and provide an Afro-American critique of pragmatism and value absolutism, and also offer a view of identity, communicative competency, and contextualism. In addition, his major works on the nature of race, race relations, and the role of race-conscious literature are presented to demonstrate the application of his philosophy. Locke�s commentaries on the major philosophers of his day, including James, Royce, Santayana, Perry, and Ehrenfels help tell the story of his relationship to his former teachers and his theoretical affinities.

<p>In his substantial Introduction and interpretive concluding chapter, Leonard Harris describes Locke�s life, evaluates his role as an American philosopher and theoretician of the Harlem Renaissance, situates him in the pragmatist tradition, and outlines his affinities with modern deconstructionist ideas. A chronology of the philosopher�s life and bibliography of his works are also provided. Although much has been written about Alain Locke, this is the first book to focus on his philosophical contributions.

<h2 class="inpageheading"><A NAME="reviews"></a>Reviews</h2>
<P><p><I>"There is absolutely no doubt that this book is a very useful addition to the corpus of work in Afro American&#151indeed, in American&#151philosophy.  Locke's unpublished work on the question of value reveals a good deal about the ways in which American philosophers approached questions of value in the mid-century, before logical positivism had had its major impact on American thought; and his contributions to the issue of cultural pluralism are historically important and still influential."</I>
<br>&#151<b>Anthony Appiah</b>, Cornell University

<p><I>"A challenging book.  It forces the reader to cross interdisciplinary boundaries that are not often transgressed."</I>
<br>&#151<b><I>Ethics</I></b>

<p><I>"It is the first volume to anthologize the specifically </I>philosophical<I> writings of an Afro-American savant who is virtually unknown as a philosopher.  It thereby introduces us to a new Alain Locke.  And this occurs at a time when a number of younger Afro-American philosophers have become increasingly curious about their ancient sage."</I>
