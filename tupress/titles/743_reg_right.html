<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>"This is an original and provocative work that asserts&#151and arguably demonstrates&#151the conjunction between ethics and metaphysics.  Stahl writes in an authentic and distinctive voice; he not only presents arguments&#151it is clear that he also believes them.  The point he stresses repeatedly is not a version of 'compatibilism' between science and ethics, between the material and moral worlds&#151but the necessity of the relation between them (and so also, of course, of its possibility).  This is an important thesis from which both moral philosophers and researchers in the sciences can learn.  Stahl calls attention to significant issues in ethics and in the relation between ethics and epistemology&#151and does this in a way that is at once challenging and evocative.  This is a valuable addition to the literature."</I>
<br>&#151<b>Berel Lang</b>, State University of New York at Albany<I></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Given the evolutionary and developmental processes that form a human being, can we plausibly believe that people can make rational and autonomous choices about their lives?  How can such choices be non-arbitrary and compelling if there are no norms outside the historical process against which they can be judged?  And if that historical process is simply an accidental episode in an indifferent universe, what sorts of meanings can individual lives and choices have?

<p>These are the questions that Gary H. Stahl addresses in this original and provocative work.  Drawing on arguments from biology and psychology as well as from the history of philosophy, Stahl examines the naturalistic meaning that can be assigned to moral agency, choice, and responsibility, in order to assert the conjunction between ethics and metaphysics.  His focus is the process within which the self and the other, defined in terms of each other, emerge within evolution and development so as to generate an irreducible level of meaning.
