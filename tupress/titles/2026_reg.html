</P><BLOCKQUOTE><I>"If this book doesn�t fascinate you, crime control policy is not your subject. The editors and contributors do a wonderful job of illuminating criminological theory, while never forgetting good theory should inform good policy. The ideas in </i>Criminology and Public Policy<i> should go a long way in helping us finally get crime policy right."</i>
<br>&#151<b>Brian J. Ostrom</b>, Principal Research Consultant, National Center for State Courts<i></I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Crime policy ought to be guided by science rather than ideology, argue Hugh Barlow and Scott Decker in this incisive and original collection of essays. Establishing the value and importance of linking theory and practice, the contributors to <i>Criminology and Public Policy</i> provide a comprehensive treatment of the major theories in criminology and their implications for criminal justice, crime control, and the larger realm of justice.</p><p>

In applying theories to real world issues&#151such as reducing crime and violence, prisoner reentry policies, gang behavior, and treatment courts&#151the contributors take both a macro and micro level approach. They find, too, that it is often difficult to turn theory into practice. Still, the very attempt pushes the criminal justice system toward workable solutions rather than ideological approaches, an orientation the editors believe will lead to greater progress in combating one of our society�s greatest difficulties.</p><p>

<BR>&nbsp;<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p><i>"This well-edited, highly readable book clearly demonstrates how criminological theory can, and does, contribute to policy solutions. Prominent scholars provide succinct summaries of current theories and innovative policy implications for crimes ranging from   state crime to street crime. Criminology and public policy students should read this book, as should policy makers and criminal justice professionals."</i>
<br>&#151<b>Margaret A. Zahn</b>, Professor of Sociology, North Carolina State University, and past president of the American Society of Criminology

<p><i>"</i>Criminology and Public Policy<i> will fill a significant void in academic criminology and in theory- and research-based practice in the field"</i><br>&#151<b>John Klofas</b>, Professor of Criminal Justice and Chair of the Department, Rochester Institute of Technology

<p><i>"The editors of this book are to be commended for inviting some key theorists to 'think policy.'... The contributors make apparent the distance between professional criminology and policy makers.... Summing Up: Recommended."</i> <br>&#151<b><i>CHOICE</i></b>

<p><i>"Criminologists should gain confidence that criminological theorizing is not an empty exercise; it can both help to understand that social world and change it."</i> <br>&#151<b><i>Contemporary Sociology</i></b>
