</P><BLOCKQUOTE><I>"[These essays] represent the power of the written word as a vehicle for advocacy and social change &#133.  It is my hope that the readers of these essays will themselves feel compelled to think more about the importance of taking a stand on issues from religious perspectives, and to act on something that compels them."</I>
<BR>&#151<B>Rabbi Rebecca Alpert</B><I></I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>What has happened to the religious left?  If there is a religious left, why don't we hear more about it?

<P>The academics and activists who write this rich volume, edited by Rebecca Alpert, argue passionately on topics that concern all of us.  Quoting from the Bible, the Torah, the Qur'an, the teachings of Buddha, as well as Native American folklore, they make the voices of the religious left heard&#151teaching lessons of peace and liberation.

<P>As this invaluable sourcebook shows, the religious left is committed to issues of human rights and dignity.  Answering questions of identity and ideology, the essays included here stem from the "culture wars" that have divided orthodox and liberal believers.  Responding to the needs of and raised by marginalized social groups, the writers discuss economic issues and religious politics as they champion equal rights, and promote the teaching of progressive vision.

<P>Containing insightful perspectives of adherents to many faiths, <I>Voices of the Religious Left</I> makes it clear that there <I>is</I> a group dedicated to instilling the values of justice and freedom.  They are far from silent.

<BR>&nbsp;<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p><i>"...chock-full of politically engaged, theologically and textually grounded essays.... Many of the essays also provide serious spiritual ammunition.... </i>Voices<i> illuminates the ways some people have taken their sense of religious duty out into a broken world and infused their in-the-trenches </i>tikkun olam<i> with a relationship to the bigger picture.  The magic here is both in the details and in the sweeping sense that we are all, in fact, working toward the same goals from, as somebody once said, a thousand points of light.  Until we can get there, </i>Voices of the Religious Left<i> offers indispensable, high-octane edification and inspiration&#151just what we'll need along the way."</i>
<br>&#151<b>Danya Rutttenberg</b>, <i>LILITH</i>

<p><i>"Alpert's collection is of genuine service for understanding and engaging with contemporary perspectives of 'the religious left'..."</i>
<br>&#150<b><i>Nova Religio</i></b>

<p><i>"This book does a fine job of showing how the religious left can be part of religious belief, including for those who, for the most part, adhere to fairly traditional religious beliefs."</i>
<br>&#151<b><i>Journal of Church and State</i></b>
