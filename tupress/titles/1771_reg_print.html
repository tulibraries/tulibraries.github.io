From his classic </i>False Promises<i> to this courageous and timely book, he has put forward the most profound analysis and challenging vision of deep democracy here and abroad."</i>
<br>&#151<b>Cornel West</b>, Princeton University<i></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><p>Americans have always believed that economic growth leads to job growth. In this groundbreaking analysis, Stanley Aronowitz argues that this is no longer true. <i>Just Around the Corner</i> examines the state of the American economy as planned by Democrats and  Republicans over the last thirty years. Aronowitz finds that economic growth has become "delinked" from job creation, and that unemployment and underemployment are a permanent condition of our economy. He traces the historical roots of this state of affairs and sees under the surface of booms and busts a continuum of economic austerity that creates financial windfalls for the rich at the expense of most Americans. Aronowitz also explores the cultural and political processes by which we have come to describe and accept economics in the United States. He concludes by presenting a concrete plan of action that would guarantee employment and living wages for all Americans.

<p>With both measured analysis and persuasive reasoning, <i>Just Around the Corner</i> provides an indispensable guide to our current economic predicament and a bold challenge to economists and policymakers.</p>

<BR><H2 class="inpageheading">Reviews</h2><p>
<p><i>"</i>Just Around the Corner<i> is a highly readable and thought-provoking examination of the structural joblessness that is affecting wider segments of the population. This timely book should be read and debated by all those concerned about the future of American workers in the global economy."</i>
<br>&#151<b>William Julius Wilson</b>, Lewis P. and Linda L. Geyser University Professor, Harvard University

<p><i>"Aronowitz writes well and makes a persuasive case that will no doubt be challenged by mainstream neoliberal economists. But it will be difficult to undermine the solid empirical data he has amassed to show that the problem of economic growth without sustainable and remunerative employment presents a huge challenge for the future."</i>
<br>&#151;<b><i>The Journal of Sociology and Social Welfare</i></b>

<p><i>"The author finds a way to strongly argue against the so-called neoliberal policy measures and then proposes policy changes toward ensuring that good jobs are really around the corner...</i>[Just Around the Corner]<i> provides a useful discussion focused on the labor aspect of the recent U.S. socioeconomic policies and globalization trends."</i>
<br>&#151;<b><i>Perspectives on Political Science</i></b>

<p><i>“Aronowitz has interesting and provocative things to say…. [</i>Just Around the Corner<i>] may be useful for relative newcomers seeking stimulating theses on what is wrong with the U.S. economy.”</i>
<br>&#151;<b><i>Contemporary Sociology </i></b>
