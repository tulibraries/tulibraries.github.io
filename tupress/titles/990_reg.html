</P><ul><I><li><p>Does fibrocystic breast disease put you at greater risk for breast cancer?
<li><p>When is the best age to talk to your child about sex?
<li><p>Why is exercise so good at relieving stress?
<li><p>Should you automatically accept the doctor assigned by a hospital?
<li><p>Does aspirin help reduce your risk of heart disease?
<li><p>Should you take vitamin supplements as part of a healthy diet?</I></ul>

<p>As a family practitioner, Dr. Brian McDonough believes that everyone should have a general understanding of how their bodies work, what they can do to develop healthy lifestyles, when to consult a health care provider, and how to use the health care system wisely.  Dr. McDonough has brought together sixteen leading experts to address common health problems and disease prevention.  In easy-to-understand language, each expert discusses the fundamentals of topics ranging from routine problems to life-threatening diseases.

<p>Based on the format of Dr. McDonough's syndicated radio program, "Health Talk America," this book features straightforward answers to the questions mostly commonly asked by members of the radio audience in response to each topic.  <I>Talking Health</I> targets the subjects likely to be of concern to you or someone you know&#151including AIDS, cancers, children's health and diet, exercise and sports medicine, eye conditions, heart health and disease, nutrition and disease prevention, pregnancy management, sinusitis and allergies, skin conditions, sleep regulation, and voice disorders.  One of the many highlights of this book is a chapter on health care choices; its suggestions for finding a good doctor or hospital, preparing for a hospital stay, and handling the cost of medical care will help alleviate the anxiety often experienced when faced with these realities.

<p>The clear, nontechnical explanations make <I>Talking Health</I> an invaluable resource for those of us who take an active role in achieving and maintaining good health.
