<P>The result of work initiated by the Harvard Civil Rights Project, this collection provides an excellent overview of the contemporary racial and ethnic terrain in the United States. The well-respected contributors to <I>Twenty-First Century Color Lines</I> combine theoretical and empirical perspectives, answering fundamental questions about the present and future of multiracialism in the United States: How are racial and ethnic identities promoted and defended across a spectrum of social, geopolitical and cultural contexts? What do two generations of demographic and social shifts around issues of race look like “on the ground?” What are the socio-cultural implications of changing demographics in the U.S.? And what do the answers to these questions portend for our multiracial future?</P>

<P>This illuminating book addresses issues of work, education, family life and nationality for different ethnic groups, including Asians and Latinos as well as African Americans and whites. Such diversity, gathered here in one volume, provides new perspectives on ethnicity in a society marked by profound racial transformations.</P>

<BR>&nbsp;<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p><i>"A useful edited collection of essays on diverse US racial-ethnic issues, this book grew out of a 2003 Harvard Civil Rights Project conference.... These respected scholars provide a well-documented overview of US racial-ethnic patterns and conflicts. Summing Up: Recommended."</i> <br>&#151<b><i>Choice</i></b>

<p><i>"Collectively, the papers in this volume provide a thoughtful account of both the opportunities and challenges we confront in light of increasing racial and ethnic diversity, and will appeal to academics, practitioners, activists, and policy makers interested in better understanding how the problems of the twenty-first century will be shaped by a multiracial color line."</i><br>&#151<b><i>Contemporary Sociology </i></b>

<p><i>"By considering race in a range of novel ways, the chapters taken together present a fairly honest and rigorous inventory of the state of racial inequality in this country...If there is a theme to this eclectic mix, it is to highlight again and again the myriad ongoing racial disparities that shape this nation. As such, the volume is a good counterargument to those who would offer a celebratory narrative about the postracial nature of America’s political and social structures.... [It] make[s an] important contribution to the study of racial politics in the United States....[and] deserve[s] to be read."</i> <br>&#151<b><i>Perspectives on Politics</i></b>
