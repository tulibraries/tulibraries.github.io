<P><p>This unique text offers a discussion of one of the most important movements in legal scholarship today: feminist legal theory.  The first of two volumes, <I>Foundations</I> examines theoretical issues about the interaction between law and gender.  The second volume will explore the application of feminist legal theory to specific substantive areas of the law, such as criminal law, family law, employment law, and the legal profession.  In this first volume, thirty-eight articles by distinguished legal scholars and feminists address issues of equality, difference, separate spheres, essentialism, legal methodology, and theories of law.  The essays, published in widely dispersed legal publications, are thematically arranged, with introductions by the editor, to provide a text for students, a convenient source for scholars and policy makers, and a comprehensive introduction for general readers.</p>

<p><I>"D. Kelly Weisberg's distinguished volume will provide one-stop shopping for newspaper editors, scholars, political activists, and public officials who want to learn how gender analysis applies to legal thought."</I>
<br>&#151<b>Barbara J. Nelson</b>, University of Minnesota

<p><I>"Feminist jurisprudence is the cauldron in which some of the most creative feminist thoughts are brewing.  Their release into our sociopolitical environment will bring us somewhat closer to creating a legal system in which the interests of all persons are indeed regarded with equal respect and consideration.  Anglo-American law has been in need of a feminist transformation for some time.  Weisberg's anthology suggests that the moment of metamorphosis is upon us."</I>
<br>&#151<b>Rosemarie Tong</b>, Thatcher Professor in Philosophy and Medical Humanities, Davidson College

<p><I>"Professor Weisberg has successfully undertaken the daunting task of presenting many of the diverse strands of feminist legal theory in a coherent, organized framework.  The ideas presented in this stimulating collection of essays are at the cutting-edge of legal theory."</I>
