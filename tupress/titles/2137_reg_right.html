<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>"A veritable cheesesteak between covers, Mike Tanier's </I>The Philly Fan's Code<I> is a book no self-respecting Philadelphia sports fan can be without."</I><br> &#151<b>Gregg Easterbrook</b>, ESPN</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Face it: Philadelphia athletes are often as tough as their fans are passionate. How else to explain the rabid appeal of the bone-crunching Broad Street Bullies? Chuck Bednarik was one of the looniest tunes in Philadelphia sports history, but <i>fuggedabout</i> him. In <i>The Philly Fan's Code</i>, <i>New York Times</i> sportswriter Mike Tanier provides fun and opinionated essays that evaluate the 50 greatest, toughest, and most eccentric legends of Philly sports since Concrete Charlie hung up his cleats.

<p>Using his own "rubric" to calculate the impact of each athlete, Tanier ranks well-adjusted players like Mark Howe alongside both unpredictable athletes like Brad Lidge&#8212;who followed an almost perfect season with a 162-game catastrophe&#8212;and quirky ones, such as Wilt Chamberlain, who may be better known for bragging about his sexual conquests than for scoring 100 points in a game.  And let's not forget our visitor from Planet Lovetron�  Then there are the <i>real</i> wild cards-players like Terrell Owens, who does sit-ups in his driveway and whose impact&#8212for better or worse&#8212
outlasted the few actual games he played for the Eagles. As for Tanier's choice for the No. 1 toughest, craziest, most legendary player, well, you'll have to read the book to see if you agree. Whether you do or don't, <i>The Philly Fan's Code</i> will provide hours of debates and memories of who our toughest sports heroes were&#8212;or weren't.

<P><p><I>"Honest, incisive, funny, and compulsively readable, </I>The Philly Fan's Code<I> is the perfect book for Philly sports fans. Mike Tanier offers a fresh take on age-old debates about the legacies of the city's most memorable and controversial athletes, inviting readers to reconsider the reputation and history of Philadelphia fans." </I><br>&#151<b>Tom McAllister</b>, author of <i>Bury Me in My Jersey: A Memoir of My Father, Football, and Philly</i>

<p><I>"Mike Tanier may have once booed me, but I have nothing but praise for his snappy little argument starter, </I>The Philly Fan's Code<I>. I�m honored to be included in this book�just not sure why I wasn�t ranked higher!"</I> <br>&#151<b>Ron Jaworski </b>

<p><I>"[Tanier] has written a terrific book... [H]e's got his tongue so far up his cheek, you can see it sticking out his left ear. That just makes his list livelier, more kindling for a fiery debate... Let's cut to the chase. Tanier nails Bobby Clarke, Wilt Chamberlain and Charles Barkley dead-on. ...The book gets high grades for telling me things I didn't know before." </I> <br>&#151<b><i>The Philadelphia Daily News </b></i></p>
