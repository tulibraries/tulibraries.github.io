</P><p>Although he is generally recognized as one of the leading analysts of contemporary social movements, few of Alberto Melucci’s writings have been published in English. <I>Nomads of the Present</I> makes available for the first time in English a coherent and representative sample of Melucci’s most important essays. This synthesis of his work on social movements is no mere collection of previously published essays: each chapter draws on the author’s work in several different places. Of the thirteen interrelated essays in this volume, only five have been published elsewhere in English. The book also features an interview with Alberto Melucci conducted by John Keane and Paul Mier.
