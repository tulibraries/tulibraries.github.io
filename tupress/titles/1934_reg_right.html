<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>"On the Margins of Citizenship <I>is a remarkable book.

<p><i>On the Margins of Citizenship</i> provides a comprehensive, sociological history of the fight for civil rights for people with intellectual disabilities. Allison Carey, who has been active in disability advocacy and politics her entire life, draws upon a broad range of historical and legal documents as well as the literature of citizenship studies to develop a �relational-practice� approach to the issues of intellectual disability and civil rights. She examines how and why parents, self-advocates, and professionals fought for different visions of rights for this population throughout the twentieth century and the changes that took place over that time.</p>
<p>Carey addresses the segregation of people with intellectual disabilities in schools and institutions, along with the controversies over forced sterilization, eugenics, marriage and procreation, and protection from the death penalty. She chronicles the rise of the parents� movement and the influence of the Kennedy family, as well as current debates that were generated by the impact of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>
<p>Presenting the shifting constitutional and legal restrictions for this marginalized group, Carey argues that policies tend to sustain an ambiguity that simultaneously promises rights yet also allows their retraction.</p>

<P><P><i>"</i>On the Margins of Citizenship<i> makes an important contribution to the sociology and American history of intellectual disability. It draws together and analyzes the development of legal rights that affect people with this disability. I am especially impressed with Carey's theoretical grounding. It is clear, succinct, and convincing. This is an excellent work that will prove to be important to scholars and activists interested in intellectual disability." </i><BR><B>&#151James Trent</B>, Professor of Sociology, Gordon College </P>

<p><i>"Carey carefully summarizes...the continuing problematic issues for people facing intellectual disabilities, while seeking inclusion by changing the definitions of citizenship.... Summing Up: Highly recommended." </i>
<br>&#151<b><i>CHOICE</i></b>

<p><i>"Carey succeeds in describing how rights for the intellectually disabled have been conceptualised in the USA. What could have been a dry legal history is made interesting by numerous case studies and Carey�s passionate, yet nuanced, approach to the issues at hand. Ultimately, this is a call to help those who struggle to fit into and succeed in a competitive, often ruthless, society reach their potential. If we are able to help them do so, we may also be living up to our potential as well." </i><br>&#151<b><i>The Social History of Medicine</i></b>

<p><i>"In addition to providing an excellent history of intellectual disability in modern America, Carey has given us a model of the questions we need to ask and the themes we need to trace in the ideological histories of all disabilities."</i><br>&#151<b><i>H-Disabilities</i></b>

<p><i>"[W]ritten in an engaging style with relevant and appropriate evidence and examples. It provides a competent argument for the need to change attitudes and challenge the perception of the status of people with intellectual disabilities in the legal system in America....[T]he message is emotive and convincing.... The book is very well researched."</i> <br>&#151<b><i>Contemporary Sociology</i></b></p>
