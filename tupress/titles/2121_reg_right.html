<p><em>&quot;Move with the numbers, count to the beat. Clap your hands. Tap your feet. Count one two three four, with your Head Shoulders Elbows Hands Arms Hips Knees Feet!&quot;</em> 
</p>
<p>Early childhood educator Teresa Benzwie believes that dance and movement foster imagination, which is essential to the learning process. Her philosophy&#151that creative movement helps children gain knowledge through the body&#151is incorporated in <em>Numbers on the Move</em>, an appealing and entertaining book that urges kids to dance, stretch, and move as they learn to count and play with numbers.
</p>
<p>Featuring playful, full-color illustrations, this book offers dynamic activities for children, who learn most readily from experience. For parents and teachers, Benzwie provides additional games and activities to try with children. Kids will develop a concrete awareness of numbers as they connect in deep, direct ways with their own expressive movement.
