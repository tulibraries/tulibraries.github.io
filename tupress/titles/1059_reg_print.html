<br>&#151<b><I>Journal of the American Planning Association</I></b><I></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><p><I>Reinventing Cities</I> emphasizes the extraordinary accomplishments of eleven urban planners who work for the needs of low income and working class people.  Through the voices of equity planners who have worked "in the trenches" of city halls, Norman Krumholz and Pierre Clavel explore the inner dimensions of social change, economic development, community organizing, and the dynamics of implementing and producing fair housing.  Preceded by "snapshots" that describe the demographics, politics, and economics of each specific city or region, the editors' interviews with these leading progressive planners highlight productive strategies, disquieting failures, and the cities in which the fought for equity.

<p>Included are conversations with Rick Cohen, former director of Jersey City's Department of Housing and Economic Development; Dale F. Bertsch, former first director of the Miami Valley Regional Planning Commission, Dayton, Ohio; Robert Mier, former commissioner of the Department of Economic Development (DED); Kari J. Moe, former deputy commissioner of Research and Development, DED'; Arturo Vazquez, former director of Mayor 
Washington's Office of Employment and Training, Chicago; Margaret D. Strachan, former city commissioner, Portland, Oregon; Peter Dreier, former housing director, Boston Redevelopment Authority, and policy aide to Mayor Raymond Flynn; Billie Bramhall, planning staff, Mayor Federico Pena, Denver, Colorado; Howard Stanback, city manager, Hartford, Connecticut; Derek Shearer, former Planning Commission chairman, Santa Monica, California; and Kenneth Grimes, senior planning analyst, San Diego Housing Commission.</p>
<BR><H2 class="inpageheading">Reviews</h2><p>
<p><i>"Because </i>Reinventing Cities<i> covers so much ground, the book's "case studies" are its chief value.... city governments have increasingly been forced to develop their own solutions as best they can. </i>Reinventing Cities<i> is one of the best books to date on how they have done so."</i>
<br>&#151<b><a href="http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=2162851703943" target="new">H-Net</a></b>

<p><i>"The essays are introspective, offering much about each planner's background and ways of thinking. Their stories offer both variety and similarity; anyone who has worked in community planning will find themselves nodding along in recognition and agreement with descriptions of ecstatic successes, devastating setbacks, endless meetings, and recurring fantasies of leaving the field altogether."</i>
