<BLOCKQUOTE><I>"Original and stimulating....  [Espiritu's] study raises compelling questions about the existing literature on ethnicity and her findings open up new avenues for research and analysis."</I>
<br>&#151<b>Michael Omi</b>, University of California, Berkeley, co-author of <I>Racial Formation in the U.S. from the 1960s to the 1980s</I><I></I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>With different histories, cultures, languages, and identities, most Americans of Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Korean, and Vietnamese origin are lumped together and viewed by other Americans simply as Asian Americans.  Since the mid 1960s, however, these different Asian American groups have come together to promote and protect both their individual and their united interests.  The first book to examine this particular subject, <I>Asian American Panethnicity</I> is a highly detailed case study of how, and with what success, diverse national-origin groups can come together as a new, enlarged panethnic group.

<p>Yen Le Espiritu explores the construction of large-scale affiliations, in which previously unrelated groups submerge their differences and assume a common identity.  Making use of extensive interviews and statistical data, she examines how Asian panethnicity protects the rights and interests of all Asian American groups, including those, like the Vietnamese and Cambodians, which are less powerful and prominent than the Chinese and Japanese.  By citing specific examples&#151educational discrimination, legal redress, anti-Asian violence, the development of Asian American Studies programs, social services, and affirmative action&#151the author demonstrates how Asian Americans came to understand that only by cooperating with each other would they succeed in fighting the racism they all faced.

</p><p>Founded by Sucheng Chan in 1991, the <I>Asian American History and Culture</I>, series has sponsored innovative scholarship that has redefined, expanded, and advanced the field of Asian American studies while strengthening its links to related areas of scholarly inquiry and engaged critique. Like the field from which it emerged, the series remains rooted in the social sciences and humanities, encompassing multiple regions, formations, communities, and identities. Extending the vision of founding editor Sucheng Chan and emeriti editor Michael Omi and David Palumbo-Liu, series editors K. Scott Wong, Linda Trinh Võ, and Cathy Schlund-Vials continue to develop a foundational collection that embodies a range of theoretical and methodological approaches to Asian American studies.</p>
