<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>"A useful resource for planners an activist working on housing development.  It provides a wealth of information about the positive and negative outcomes of various federal and local initiatives."</I>
<br>&#151<b><I>International Journal of Urban and Regional Research</I></b><I></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Examining earlier federal housing initiatives, Rachel Bratt argues that public housing has not failed. She proposes a new strategy for producing decent, affordable housing for low-income people through non-profit community-based organizations.

<p>The potential of a new housing policy built on empowering community groups and low-income households is compelling. The production, rehabilitation, management and/or ownership by community-based organizations, with funding and technical assistance provided by a new type of public support system, not only would offer participants much-needed shelter, but also control over and security in their living environments. These qualities have been lacking in housing sponsored by the private for-profit sector as well as in previous subsidy programs.

<p>The author analyzes the limitations of both profit-oriented developers and public agencies as the primary vehicles for developing low- and middle-income housing. Promoting small-scale neighborhood organizations as better suited for delivering such services, she focuses on large multi-family projects and argues that our urban public housing stock represents an irreplaceable resource that is rapidly decaying to a point of no return. Through a number of case studies of housing projects throughout Massachusetts&#151among them South Holyoke, the Granite Properties, Fields Corner in Dorchester, and the Boston Housing Partnership&#151Bratt examines the dilemmas faced by community development corporations, analyzes the accomplishments of empowered community groups, and recommends ways of <I>Rebuilding a Low-Income Housing Policy</I>.

<P><p><I>"[L]ittle work has been done to show that a community-based housing program is a viable alternative.  Rachel Bratt's new book...fills this void nicely by giving a detailed account of the recent emergence of community-based housing programs....Bratt is perhaps the country's leading expert in this area....While the main emphasis of the book is on community-based housing programs, an additional plus is a critical review of the history of United States housing programs which I found illuminating and insightful."</I>
