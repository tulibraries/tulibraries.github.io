</P><BLOCKQUOTE><I>"In </i>The Identity Dilemma<i>, McGarry and Jasper assemble the work of a diverse and talented group of scholars who together shed light on the crucial role of collective identity in contemporary social movements in a range of national settings. Building on recent scholarship that has revolutionized research on social movements in the last decades, this book stands out for its careful attention to the role of emotions in social movements as well as to various dilemmas that militants and movements face. This contribution is a must-read for social scientists interested in stimulating and studying social change."</i> <br>&#151<b>Michele Lamont</b>, Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, Harvard University, and co-editor (with Nissim Mizrachi) of <i>Responses to Stigmatization in Comparative Perspective</i></I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Collective identities are politically necessary, or at least useful, as banners for recruiting others and engaging opponents and the state. However, not every member fits or accepts the label in the same way or to the same degree. <I>The Identity Dilemma</I> provides eight diverse case studies of social movements to show the benefits, risks, and tradeoffs when a group develops a strong sense of collective identity. 
 
<P>The editors and contributors to this pathbreaking volume examine how collective identities can provide powerful advantages but also generate conflicts. The various chapters help to develop our understanding of collective identity from how strategic identities are developed for protest groups to how stigmatized groups negotiate identity dilemmas. 

<P>Ultimately, <I>The Identity Dilemma</I> contributes a new strategic approach to understanding social movements that highlights the choices and tensions that groups inevitably face in articulating their ideas and interests.
