<P><p>What does it mean to be queer and Asian-American at the turn of the century? The writers, activists, essayists, and artists who contribute to this volume consider how Asian-American racial identity and queer sexuality interconnect in mutually shaping and complicating ways. Their collective aim (in the words of the editors) is "to articulate a new conception of Asian-American racial identity, its heterogeneity, hybridity, and multiplicity-concepts that have after all underpinned the Asian-American moniker from its very inception.

<p><I>Q & A</I> approaches matters of identity from a variety of points of view and academic disciplines in order to explore the multiple crossings of race and ethnicity with sexuality and gender. Drawing together the work of visual artists, fiction writers, community organizers, scholars, and participants in roundtable discussions, the collection gathers an array of voices and experiences that represent the emerging communities of a queer Asian-America. Collectively, these contributors contend that Asian-American studies needs to be more attentive to issues of sexuality and that queer studies needs to be more attentive to other aspects of difference, especially race and ethnicity. Vigorously rejecting the notion that a symmetrical relationship between race and homosexuality would weaken lesbian/gay and queer movements, the editors refuse to "believe that a desirably queer world is one in which we remain perpetual aliens-queer houseguests-in a queer nation.</p>

<p><I>"The writers, artists, and activists in </I>Q & A<I> take us to so many fascinating places where 'queer' and 'Asian American' cross paths, that we end up seeing all of American history from a new angle of vision.  This brilliant, provocative collection makes clear the kind of intelligence we lose whenever it's assumed that history is heterosexual and that 'queer' equals 'white.'"</I>
<br>&#151<b>Alan Bérubé</b>, author of <I>Coming Out Under Fire: The History of Gay Men and Women in World War Two</I>

<p><I>"This is a spectacular set of essays that compel an important and creative shifting of perspective within every page.  What is 'queer' and what is 'Asian American' turn out to be vitally defined by one another.  Timely, brave, necessary, and incisive, this book should change every field that it touches."</I>
<br>&#151<b>Judith Butler</b>, University of California, Berkeley

<p><I>"A breakthrough gathering of voices, astounding in their individual clarity and their collective diversity... </I>Q & A<I> presents a compelling challenge to those who cling to the notion that race and sexual orientation can be considered separate identities, rather than interwoven, interdependent aspects of one's singular social/political self."</I>

Scott Wong, Linda Trinh Võ, and Cathy Schlund-Vials.
</p><p>Founded by Sucheng Chan in 1991, the <I>Asian American History and Culture</I>, series has sponsored innovative scholarship that has redefined, expanded, and advanced the field of Asian American studies while strengthening its links to related areas of scholarly inquiry and engaged critique. Like the field from which it emerged, the series remains rooted in the social sciences and humanities, encompassing multiple regions, formations, communities, and identities. Extending the vision of founding editor Sucheng Chan and emeriti editor Michael Omi and David Palumbo-Liu, series editors K. Scott Wong, Linda Trinh Võ, and Cathy Schlund-Vials continue to develop a foundational collection that embodies a range of theoretical and methodological approaches to Asian American studies.</p>
