<br>&#151<b>R.G. Frey</b>, Bowling Green State University<I></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><p>With the current composition of the Supreme Court and recent challenges to <I>Roe v. Wade</I>, Peter S. Wenz's new approach to the ethical, moral, and legal issues related to a woman's right to elective abortion may turn the tide in this debate.  He argues that the Supreme Court reached the right decision in <I>Roe v. Wade</I> but for the wrong reasons.  Wenz contends that a woman's right to terminated her pregnancy should be based, not on her constitutional right to privacy, but on the constitutional guarantee of religious freedom, a basis for freedom of choice that is not subject to the legal criticisms advanced against Roe.  At least up to the 20th week of a pregnancy, one's belief whether a human fetus is a human person or not is a religious decision.  He maintains that because questions about the moral status of a fetus are religious, it follows that anti-abortion legislation, to the extent that it is predicated on such "inherently religious beliefs," is unconstitutional.

<p>In this timely and topical book, Wenz also examines related cases that deal with government intervention in an individual's procreative life, the regulation of contraceptives, and other legislation that is either applied to or imposed upon select groups of people (e.g., homosexuals, drug addicts).  He builds a concrete argument that could replace <I>Roe v. Wade</I>.</p>
<BR><H2 class="inpageheading">Reviews</h2><p>
<p><I>"In this important study of abortion and the Constitiution, legal philosopher Peter Wenz contends that Roe v. Wade was wrongly argued but well conlcuded.  Wenz presents a substantial review of Supreme Court decisions on abortion, then critically exposes flaws, including the privacy justification for abortion as well as the trimester scheme.</I>
<br>&#151<b><I>Religious Studies Review</I></b>

<p><I>"In this major work, Peter Wenz has analyzed the relation of the Constitution's religion clauses to the abortion controversy.  His principal contribution is to shift the argument from the right of privacy (invoked, he believes, unsuccessfully in </I>Roe v. Wade<I>) to the Establishment Clause.  The Court's concern in </I>Roe<I> was whether the statute unduly burdened a fundamental right.  But tested by the Establishment Clause, statutes may violate the Constitution by implicitly endorsing a religious belief, namely, the personhood of the unborn.  Wenz concludes that the Establishment Clause permits abortions prior to the twenty-first week of pregnancy."</I>
<br>&#151<b>C. Herman Prichett</b>, Professor of Political Science Emeritus, University of California, Santa Barbara

<p><I>"This is an original and scholarly exposition of the view that abortion rights fall under the religion clauses of the First Amendment.  The view defended is an important alternative to the privacy defense upon which the </I>Roe v. Wade<I> decision was based and should help to expand the ethical and constitutional debate about abortion rights."</I>
