</P><BLOCKQUOTE><I>"</I>By Heart/De Memoria<I> is a very powerful book. The material is often very creative and approaches women, women's writing and women's experiences in an innovative way. People interested in U.S. Latina Literature and experiences will find this book moving, interesting, and of use."</I>
<br>&#151<b>Eliana Rivero</b>, Spanish and Portuguese Dept., The University of Arizona<I></I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>In this moving account of the Cuban Revolution and its aftermath, eleven women who lived through it as children or young adults recall the events of the last forty years. In Torres's words, "This book, which began in Miami, looking toward the island, ends on the island as it gazes toward the exile community."

<p>These poets, artists and scholars represent each post-revolution exile generation. Some left Cuba in the Peter Pan airlift, some left afterward, some never left at all. Others&#151like the editor&#151left as children only to return and leave again, disillusioned with both the exile community and with Castro's island. Together they testify to the powerful intersections of memory, politics, nation, and exile.

<BR>&nbsp;<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p><I>"</I>By Heart/De Memoria<I> is another contribution to testimonial literature that almost seems de rigueur for literature and intellectually motivated Cuban exiles fleeing Castro's Cuba. de los Angeles Torres offers several unique and valuable contributions to the experience of the Cuban exile. The contributors to this volume are all women and their lament is for  a homeland which they experience sensually and emotionally. Reading their testimonies leaves the reader no doubt about their suffering and grief, and it offers some explanation for the continued obsession with their homeland."</I>
<br>&#151<b>K. Lynn Stoner</b>, Department of History, Arizona State University

<p><i>"The book's well-defined purpose and carefully selected contributors/contributions make it one of the better volumes on the subject. It enhances the understanding of the reader with these visions of political and personal reconciliation, and its different way of defining nationhood."</i>
<br>&#151<b><i>The British Bulletin of Publications on Latin America, the Caribbean, Portugal, and Spain</i></b>

<p><i>"[F]ascinating... never before have we seen such refreshing, evocative and balanced testimonials written exclusively by women.... These eleven essays and poems represent more than an invaluable contribution to U.S. Latina/o studies and Women's Studies, they are a continuation of the dialogue and an essential element in the construction of cuban�a."</i>
