</P><p>In this comprehensive survey of the psychology of women, Unger and Crawford establish the importance of having a separate field of inquiry for female psychology. As they expose the ways in which psychology in the past emphasized the differences among sex, gender, and cognitive abilities in men and women, the authors incorporate recent research on sexual preference and on racial, ethnic, and class diversity among women, as well as material on minority women, lesbians, and disabled women. Examining the interaction of social, situational, and biological factors, Unger and Crawford offer this book as "an invitation to explore the knowledge and participate in the ongoing debates of psychology's reconstruction of the female."

<p>The broad scope of <I>Women and Gender</I>, its emphasis on cultural diversity, and the authors' use of anecdotal and interview material make this book an unusually complete as well as a lively and accessible reference. Themes covered in the book include changing stereotypes, relationships and commitments, status and power relationships between men and women, adolescence, and gender-role socialization, among many others. Since the new psychology of women and gender developed in a social context of feminism, the authors explore the meanings of feminism, and draw on a variety of feminist perspectives to clarify particular topics.
