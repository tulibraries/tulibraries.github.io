You name him in Big 5 history, and Lyons, a lifelong Big 5 fan and former La Salle news bureau director, will probably have interviewed him. It's a fabulous read."</I>
<br>&#151<b><I>Philadelphia Daily News</I></b><I></I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>The most famous basketball tournament in the history of college basketball is the Big Five. And the Big Five was played in the most hallowed halls of college play: the Palestra. Now, for the first time, a complete story of this Philadelphia rivalry is revealed.

<p>Robert Lyons offers the story of the Big Five from its very beginnings in 1955. At that time, many of the Big Five schools&#151La Salle University, University of Pennsylvania, St. Joseph's University, Temple University and Villanova University&#151weren't even talking to each other, and everyone predicted the tournament would end before it began. Conducting interviews with coaches and players&#151including famed Temple coach Harry Litwack's last interview before his death&#151Lyons offers the play-by-play on how the Big Five became an institution, and how it was ultimately undone by college basketball's own success.

<p>Lavishly illustrated with photographs of players, teams, coaches, and the Palestra itself, <I>Palestra Pandemonium</I> is an immediate classic, offering a chronicle of the most monumental college basketball tournament. Anywhere.
