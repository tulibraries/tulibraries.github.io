</P><BLOCKQUOTE><I>"Important and provocative, this book persuasively demonstrates that lesbian and gay history is central to understanding twentieth-century urban culture. And it rejects mere celebration for a more profound scrutiny that balances liberal against conservative aspects of the historical challenge to heterosexism."</i>
<br>&#151<b>Martin Duberman</b>, author of <i>Stonewall</i><i></I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Marc Stein's <i>City of Sisterly and Brotherly Loves</i> is refreshing for at least two reasons: it centers on a city that is not generally associated with a vibrant gay and lesbian culture, and it shows that a community was forming long before the Stonewall rebellion. In this lively and well received book, Marc Stein brings to life the neighborhood bars and clubs where people gathered and the political issues that rallied the community. He reminds us that Philadelphians were leaders in the national gay and lesbian movement and, in doing so, suggests that New York and San Francisco have for too long obscured the contributions of other cities to gay culture.

<BR>&nbsp;<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p><i>"By leaving behind the gay meccas of New York and San Francisco and training his gaze on Philadelphia, Stein has produced a gay and lesbian history that startles and informs."</i>
<br>&#151<b>John D'Emilio</b>, author of <i>Sexual Politics, Sexual Communities</i>

<p><i>"Eye-opening, often entertaining....Filled with colorful anecdotes and fun facts....Let's think of what Marc Stein has done as an act of public service to Philadelphia's gay community."</i>
<br>&#151<b>Kevin Riordan</b>, <i>Philadelphia Gay News</i>

<p><i>"Philadelphians should be proud of the courage and creativity with which their lesbian and gay fellow citizens coped with and fought oppression in the Cradle of Liberty, and Stein can clearly be proud of his pioneering book."</i>
<br>&#151<b>Doug Ireland</b>, <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i>
