<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>"</i>More Philadelphia Murals and the Stories They Tell<i> is as inspirational as it is beautiful, but is ultimately important in recounting the lives of the artists and residents whose lives are transformed by the simple stroke of a paintbrush."</i>
<br>&#151;<b><i>The Philadelphia Tribune</i></b><i></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><p>More than twenty years ago, a New Jersey artist started a project for the Philadelphia Anti-Graffiti Network that encouraged young people to paint murals on a few buildings around the city. Jane Golden could not have known that the Mural Arts Program (MAP) would become the nation's largest public art program and a model for programs throughout the country. With more than 2600 murals throughout Philadelphia, the program has brightened the lives of countless residents and tourists while providing a creative outlet for an astounding array of artists. MAP now works with more than 3000 students around the city, engaging them in a curriculum that teaches not only artistic skills but civic engagement and personal responsibility.

<p><i>More Philadelphia Murals and the Stories They Tell</i>, a sequel to the bestselling <i><a href="1601_reg.html" target="_top">Philadelphia Murals and the Stories They Tell</a></i>, shares with the earlier work its beautiful color photography, along with profiles of the artists. Featured here is the remarkable story of an unlikely artistic collaboration&#151;between boys who live in a residential facility, a community in the Kensington section of Philadelphia, and men who are incarcerated in a maximum-security state correctional facility. The 1/8 of a mile long mural they created, about balanced and restorative justice, was intended to help the young men give something back to a community they had harmed and help the community wrestle with issues around crime and violence. In the process of creating the mural, it became a life-changing experience for all involved. By recounting this story and the many others behind the works of art, <i>More Philadelphia Murals and the Stories They Tell</i> is as inspirational as it is beautiful.</p>
<BR><H2 class="inpageheading">Reviews</h2><p>
<p><i>"As with the original, 2002 </i>Philadelphia Murals<i> book, this sequel provides insights into how the murals are created and their inspirations. Not only will </i>More Philadelphia Murals<i> elegantly adorn your coffee table, it could provide the springboard to energize a young artist."</i>
