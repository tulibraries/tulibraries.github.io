<P><p>Have we learned anything from social science research? Most researchers would say we have. However, studies of many education and social services settings show little impact of research findings. The limited impact of social science is, perhaps, most obvious when we contrast the success of physical science and the resulting potential for global nuclear disaster with the limits of our understanding of how to prevent war or crime in our own neighborhoods. From the practitionersï¿½ perspective, most social science research is seen as irrelevant because it does not relate to what they do, or, at best, it provides contradictory guidance on what should be done.

<p>Many reasons can be given for the minimal impact of social science research and for the decreasing funding of such research. The editors of this volume believe that a major and frequently ignored cause is that the research community has failed to aggressively synthesize the research results and interpret from those results implications for practice and for further research. The problem, as they see it, is not a lack of doing synthesis-review, synthesis, and state-of-the-art papers appear in many journals and books. The problem is how it is done.

<p>In this volume the editors, who have done synthesis and studied the synthesis process, have assembled widely recognized researchers from many of the social sciences to examine the nature of knowledge and the relationship of research in psychology, sociology library science, education, information science, epistemology, policy research, administration, and computer science to the process of knowledge synthesis.

<p>This book has four major audiences: synthesizers or literature reviewers, search planners, policy makers, and those who study the processes of knowledge spread, dissemination, or utilization. The authors address a wide range of questions from practical questions of how to do synthesis and how to format the resulting document to such fundamental questions as what can we know, what is the impact of knowledge, and how does synthesis relate to the entire system of organizing knowledge in libraries and electronic data bases.</p>
