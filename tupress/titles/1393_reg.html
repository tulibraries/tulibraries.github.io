</P><BLOCKQUOTE><I>"A very readable account of a hopeful development in a land where the main story seemed to be the slaughter of innocent civilians.  Taylor's work advances what we know and is relevant not only to Guatemala but to the struggle for peace, democracy, human rights, development, and basic decency."</I>
<br>&#151<b>Phillip Berryman</b>, author of <I>Stubborn Hope</I><I></I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>On February 13, 1982, the Guatemalan army stormed into the remote northern Guatemala village of Santa Mar�a Tzej�. The villagers had already fled in terror, but over the next six days seventeen of them, mostly women and children, were caught and massacred, animals were slaughtered, and the entire village was burned to the ground. 

<p>Twelve years later, utilizing terms of refugee agreements reached in 1982, villagers from Santa Mar�a who had fled to Mexico returned to their homes and lands to re-create their community with those who had stayed in Guatemala. <I>Return of Guatemala's Refugees</I> tells the story of that process. In this moving and provocative book, Clark Taylor describes the experiences of the survivors-both those who stayed  behind in conditions of savage repression and those who fled to Mexico where they learned to organize and defend their rights. Their struggle to rebuild is set in the wider drama of efforts by grassroots groups to pressure the government, economic elites, and army to fulfill peace accords signed in December of 1996.

<p>Focusing on the village of Santa Mar�a Tzej�, Taylor defines the challenges that faced returning refugees and their community. How did the opposing subcultures of fear (generated among those who stayed in Guatemala) and of education and human rights (experienced by those who took refuge in Mexico) coexist? Would the flood of international money sent to settle the refugees and fulfill the peace accords serve to promote participatory development or new forms of social control? How did survivors expand the space for democracy firmly grounded in human rights? How did they get beyond the grief and trauma that remained from the terror of the early eighties? Finally, the ultimate challenge, how did they work within conditions of extreme poverty to create a grassroots democracy in a militarized society?

<BR>&nbsp;<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p><I>"Using the Ixcan village of Santa Maria Tzej� as his case study, Clark Taylor makes understandable the complex process of the Guatemalan refugee return, the factors inhibiting or encouraging reintegration, and the changes wrought in the community and the region by the returnees.  This is a clear, readable and interesting contribution to the (thus far) meager Literature on the refugee return situation.  Taylor concludes with a strong call to action and gives resources for further education and work."</I>
