Dr. Yates has honed in on a crucial period in the development of the Canadian labour movement.  Unlike any previous study, she has looked inside one of the most important unions in the country to dissect the exact nature and timing of the postwar 'compromise' and the pressures on it in recent years.  This highly perceptive, analytically sophisticated, and conceptually rigorous study is far more than a narrative of union development.  It situates the UAW in a clear context of class relations and political economy and provides a solid theoretical framework for analysis that integrates the most recent thinking and writing on these subjects."</I>

<P><p>In this path-breaking discussion of Canadian labor relations, Charlotte Yates shows, through a case study of the Autoworkers Union Canada, how unions, as complex organizations engaged in strategic activities, can have a definite impact on the national political economy.  Using extensive archival materials, Yates examines how unions were demobilized in their relationships with the state, employers, and political parties as Fordist regulatory structures and practices forced unions to accept the constraints of responsible union behavior.  She argues that the Canadian Autoworkers' collective identity and internal organizational structure counteracted these demobilizing tendencies.  This historical legacy laid the groundwork for the Autoworker Union's return to militancy in the 1980s and '90s and has shaped their responses to the pressures of economic globalization and heightened competition.</p>
