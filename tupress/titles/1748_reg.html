</P><P><I>Chinese Connections</I> is a valuable new anthology that provides a prismatic look at the cross-fertilization between Chinese film and global popular culture. Leading film scholars consider the influence of world cinema on China-related and Chinese-related cinema over the last five decades. Highlighting the neglected connections between Chinese films and American and European cinema, the editors and contributors examine popular works such as Ang Lee�s <I>The Hulk</I> and Olivier Assayas� <I>Irma Vep</I> to show the nexus of international film production and how national, political, social and sexual identities are represented in the Chinese diaspora.</P>

<P>With talent flowing back and forth between East and West, <I>Chinese Connections</I> explores how issues of immigration, class, race and economic displacement are viewed on a global level, ultimately providing a greater understanding of the impact of Chinese filmmaking at home and abroad.</P>

<P>Contributors include: Grace An, Aaron Anderson, Chris Berry, Evans Chan, Li-Mei Chang, Frances Gateward, Andrew Grossman, Peter Hitchcock, Chuck Kleinhans, Jenny Kwok Wah Lau, Helen Leung, Aaron Magnan-Park, Gayle Wald, Esther C.M. Yau, Emilie Yueh-yu Yeh, Xuelin Zhou and the editors.</P>

<BR>&nbsp;<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p><i>"According to its editors�</i>Chinese Connections<i> blazes a new trail, and it is easy to agree with them.... At times, the eclecticism of the contributions threatens to thwart the attempts of the book�s editors to impose order; but in a sense, it is the sheer scope and number of its essays which furnish this volume with its core strength. </i>Chinese Connections<i> contains 19 chapters in a volume just shy of 300 pages; and these pieces manage to cover essential films and essential filmmakers at the same time as straying into less tried terrain in stimulating ways. The result is a volume that has something to say to everyone from undergraduates to film specialists. Indeed, although the last few years have seen the publication of several high-quality, broad-sweep volumes on Chinese film � both nationally and transnationally � few have quite the reach and range of this one." </i><br>&#151;<b> <i> The China Quarterly</i></b>

<p><i>"Overall, using 'transnational' China as the overarching framework, </i>Chinese Connections<i> touches on many key questions of Chinese culture, nation, and geopolitics....[The editors] point out important issues regarding the kinds of analytical frameworks we may use in analyzing global mediated culture." </i><br>&#151;<b> <i>Jump Cut</i></b>

<p><i>"The book presents various perspectives of Chinese films, showing a multiplicity of approaches in studying Chinese cinema in general. The essays are insightful and well written and they all go a long way in helping the reader to understand the many facets of Chinese cinema." </i><br>&#151;<b> <i>China Review International</i></b>
