<p><I>Gatherings in Diaspora</I> brings together the latest chapters in the long-running chronicle of religion and immigration in the American experience. Today, as in the past, people migrating to the United States bring their religions with them, and their religious identities often mean more to them away from home, in their diaspora, than they did before.   

<p>This book explores and analyzes the diverse religious communities of post-1965 diasporas: Christians, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Rastafarians, and practitioners of Vodou, from countries such as China, Guatemala, Haiti, India, Iran, Jamaica, Korea, and Mexico. The contributors explore how, to a greater or lesser extent, immigrants and their offspring adapt their religious institutions to American conditions, often interacting with religious communities already established. The religious institutions they build, adapt, remodel, and adopt become worlds unto themselves, congregations, where new relations are forged within the community&#151between men and women, parents and children, recent arrival and those longer settled.

<p><i>"Seldom do volumes highlight the sources of their inspiration in such a straightforward manner as does </i>Gatherings in Diaspora<i>.... a complicated book with multiple agendas, but careful readers will benefit from the complexity and find a wealth of material for considering some of the most vital questions facing us as sociologists of religion today."</i>
