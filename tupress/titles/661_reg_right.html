<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>"Before&#151and while&#151becoming a sociologist, I drove trucks for a living.... I drove heavy-duty diesel trucks approximately 800,000 miles, working full-time and part-time for eight transport companies over a period of thirteen years....  I transported fresh produce, rock and sand, freight, gasoline and oil, jet fuel, asphalt, lumber, pipe....  To pull these loads, I drove tractors ranging from first-class Peterbilts and Kenworths to utilitarian Macks and beat-en-up 'Jimmies....  In all, driving produced a great variety of feelings and emotions."</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>From this experience, Lawrence J. Ouellet has the advantage of a rare perspective and a profound understanding of the two fundamental questions he asks in this book: Why do truck drivers work so hard even when it doesn't result in more money or other material gains? and How do truckers make sense of their behavior to themselves and to the outside world?

<p>A vivid ethnography of trucking culture, <I>Pedal to the Metal</I> documents and analyzes truckers' lives and work ethic, exploring the range of identities truckers create for themselves&#151the renegade cowboy, the company man, the voyeur, the lone king of the road.  To explain truckers' motivations, Ouellet examines the meaning of work and the motivation for excelling despite long, unsupervised hours on the road.  He finds that their occupational pride results in extraordinary efforts on the job and, subsequently, a positive sense of self.  Driving skill allows truckers to improve their hauling times, which they proudly track to the minute, and to increase their productivity and income.

<p>Truckers' knowledge of the industry's structure and the idiosyncrasies of their own company allows them to improve their ability to get and carry out assignments, to maneuver around a traditional concept of rank and seniority, and to recreate to their advantage the pervasive cultural myths that the public expects should dictate a trucker's behavior.  Whether capturing the pleasure and enchantment of trucking&#151driving under moon-lit skies across a snow-covered mountain range&#151or the miseries of boredom, bad weather, and exhausting schedules, Ouellet exhibits deep appreciation and passion for his subject.
