He brings a distinctive passion to the topic along with a wealth of analytic insights that will please readers versed in the rich lore of the sport and alert to its growing status as an exemplary vehicle of globalization</i></i>." <br>&#151<b>Andrew Ross</b>, New York University, author of<i> Fast Boat to China: Corporate Flight and the Consequences of Free Trade</i></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><p>Grant Farred is a lifelong soccer fan. He has been rooting for one team-Liverpool (England) Football Club-since he was a child. Long Distance Love explains how "football" opened up the world to a young boy growing up disenfranchised in apartheid South Africa. For Farred, being a soccer fan enabled him to establish connections with events and people throughout history and from around the globe: from the Spanish Civil War to the atrocities of the Argentine dictatorship of the 1970s and 80s; from the experience of racism under apartheid to the experience of watching his beloved Liverpool team play on English soil. 
<p>
Farred shows that issues like race, politics, and war are critical to understanding a sport, especially soccer. And he writes beautifully, with candor and lyricism. <i>Long Distance Love</i> does for football what C.L.R. James's <i>Beyond a Boundary</i> did for cricket: it provides poetry and politics in equal measure, along with insights on every page.</p>

<BR><H2 class="inpageheading">Reviews</h2><p>
<p><i>"[R]emarkable...In delightfully exuberant prose, Farred recounts a passion that, for him, borders on religion.... Long Distance Love is a playful � yet no less brilliant � work of political theory; its contribution to political thought comes from making such hopeful statements without compromising the immoderate passions that sports fandom indulge."

</p><p>As an international cultural activity for athleticism, spectatorship, and global cultural exchange, sport is unmatched by any other force on earth. And yet it remains a consistently understudied dimension of history and cultural studies. <i>Sporting</i>, edited by Amy Bass, aims to contribute to the study of sport by publishing works by people across a range of disciplines, by professional sportswriters, and by athletes to add substance to our still emerging notion of globalization.</p>
