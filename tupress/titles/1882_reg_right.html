<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>"Roderick Bush has produced an outstanding and original work that will allow scholars to effectively reframe many central issues pertaining to the history of race-based social movements and Black political thought specifically and radical social movements of the past 40 years more generally."</i><BR>&#151<b>David Baronov</b>, Associate Professor of Sociology,
St. John Fisher College</p></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p><i>The End of White World Supremacy</i> explores a complex issue&#151
integration of Blacks into White America&#151from multiple perspectives:
within the United States, globally, and in the context of movements
for social justice. Roderick Bush locates himself within a tradition of
African American activism that goes back at least to W.E.B. Du Bois.
In so doing, he communicates between two literatures&#151worldsystems
analysis and radical Black social movement history&#151and
sustains the dialogue throughout the book.</p><p>
Bush explains how racial troubles in the U.S. are symptomatic of
the troubled relationship between the white and dark worlds globally.
Beginning with an account of white European dominance leading to
capitalist dominance by White America, <i>The End of White World
Supremacy</i> ultimately wonders whether, as Myrdal argued in the
1940s, the American creed can provide a pathway to break this
historical conundrum and give birth to international social justice.</p>

<P><p><i>"In </i>The End of White World Supremacy<i>, Roderick Bush has established his status as a preeminent scholar of the Black intellectual tradition. I firmly believe that this work will become a classic which will assume an important place in the canon of African American studies and world systems theory." </i><br>&#151<b>William W. Sales, Jr.</b>, Associate Professor, Africana Studies Department, Seton Hall University, and author of From Civil Rights to <i>Black Liberation:  Malcolm X and the OAAU</i> 

<p><i>"Roderick Bush leads us on a sophisticated tour through the long and complicated history of the relations between Black radicals (intellectuals and movements) and the world Left. He comes down squarely on the need to find politically effective common ground that does not sacrifice what both have had and still have to offer in their efforts to transform the world into something far different and much better." </i><br>&#151<b>Immanuel Wallerstein</b>, Yale University 

<p><i>"</i>The End of White World Supremacy<i> is a riveting, bold, and important analysis of black radicalism's evolution during the long twentieth century. Theoretically ambitious and conceptually sophisticated, Roderick Bush has produced an invigorating and indispensible work whose wide ranging scope will appeal to a broad range of interdisciplinary scholars and students."</i><br>&#151<b>Peniel E. Joseph</b>, Tufts University and author of <i>Waiting ‘til the Midnight Hour: A Narrative History of Black Power in America</i>

<p><i>"Bush's provocative book...argues that historically, racial oppression developed hand-in-hand with class-based oppression in a global economy....Bush offers an intellectual history of black radicalism as he explores the roots of global consciousness in African Americans' struggle for equality....[H]is work does shine new light on the civil rights struggle....Bush's attention to the ways in which social movements are influenced by a long history of idea development is also refreshing."</I><br>&#151<b><i>Contemporary Sociology </b></i>

<p><i>"The book's strength rests with Bush's intimate familiarity with the central figures, debases and issues. Summing Up: Recommended." </i>
<br>&#151<b><i>CHOICE</i></b>

<p><i>"Bush has offered a very thought-provoking and challenging examination of the construction of racial capitalism (in the USA and globally) and the Black radical currents that have risen in response. As such, this book is one that not only must be read, but must be contemplated." </i>
<br>&#151<b><i>The Black Commentator</i></b>

<p><i>"A cogent, well-developed work that analyzes the Black international tradition using world-systems theory…. Bush’s discussion of the Black intellectual tradition and its many scholars, especially W.E.B. Du Bois, is particularly brilliant and will remain as a major contribution to race studies on its merits alone." </i>
<br>&#151<b><i>Journal of World Systems Research</i></b>

<p><i>"[Bush's] real contribution is in articulating black internationalism as an autonomous and unified theory of and resistance to systematic racism, which he situates somewhere between Marx and Weber – a revolutionary system of thought weary of progress and modernity.... In the end, </i>The End of White World Supremacy<i> serves as an interesting read for sociologists entering the scholarly world of politics and race."</i> <br>&#151<b><i>Social Forces</b></i>

<p><i>"Bush offers a sophisticated, ambitious, and expansive rebuff to those embracing a vision of racial idealism.... </i>The End of White World Supremacy<i> is an exceptional work of great intellectual scope, interdisciplinary methodology, and scholarly rigor that challenges and engages, while simultaneously issuing a bold call to action.... [I]t will reward scholars and students through the command and force of its scholarship." </i>
<br>&#151<b><i>Afro-Americans in New York Life and History</i></b>

<p><i>"Bush critically discusses the various social movements that sought to bring about racial equality in the United States. With detailed examples, Bush demonstrates how the 1960s social movements in the United States of America were part of a global social movement that challenged white supremacy the world over.... Although activists and scholars of colour in particular will find this book useful, the book offers critical insight for radical activists who are interested in building social movements that are based on anti-racist values. The most important lesson...is the importance of cultivating solidarity among social movements." </i>
