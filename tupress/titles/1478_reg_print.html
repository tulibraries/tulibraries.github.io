And yet if offers real hope, real ideas for change.  Every legislator in America should be locked in Solitary and forced to read </I>Prison Masculinities<I>."</I>
<br>&#151<b>Tom Fontana</b>, creator of <I>Oz</I><I></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><p>This book explores the frightening ways our prisons mirror the worst aspects of society-wide gender relations.  It is part of the growing research on men and masculinities.  The collection is unusual in that it combines contributions from activists, academics, and prisoners.

<p>The opening section, which features an essay by Angela Davis, focuses on the historical roots of the prison system, cultural practices surrounding gender and punishment, and the current expansion of corrections into the "prison-industrial complex."

<p>The next section examines the dominant or subservient roles that men play in prison and the connections between this hierarchy and male violence.  Another section looks at the spectrum of intimate relationships behind bars, from rape to friendship, and another at physical and mental health.

<p>The last section is about efforts to reform prisons and prison masculinities, including support groups for men.  It features an essay about prospects for post-release success in the community written by a man who, after doing time in Soledad and San Quentin, went on to get a doctorate in counseling.

<p>The contributions from prisoners include an essay on enforced celibacy by Mumia Abu-Jamal, as well as fiction and poetry on prison health policy, violence, and intimacy.  The creative contributions were selected from the more than 200 submissions received from prisoners.</p>

<BR><H2 class="inpageheading">Reviews</h2><p>
<p><I>"The enforced sequestration of men and women results in hard time, and invites adaptive responses that can often be unseemly, ugly, and destructive.  This book shows how male prisons have becme stages for the display and posturing of caricatured masculinity, including the victimization of vulnerable fellow-prisoners.  The contribution is impotant, timely, and challenging."</I> <br>&#151<b>Hans Toch</b>, Distinguished Professor, School of Criminal Justice, University at Albany, SUNY, and author of <I>Mosaic of Despair</I> and <I>Corrections: A Humanistic Approach</I>

<p><I>"...an intricate puzzle piece to anyone wishing to comprehend the byproducts of American culture and the criminal justice system."</I>
<br>&#151<b><I>BLU</I></b>

<p><I>"This sobering collection of essays, scientific findings, poems and heart-breaking testimonials paints a picture of a prison system held hostage by troubled masculinity."</I>
<br>&#151<b><I>Empire: Gay Man's Guide to Life</I></b>

<p><I>"</I>Prison Masculinities<I> provides an insightful look at the way that masculinity circulates in prisons and on the street. ...a long overdue examination of the hypermasculinity adopted within prisons in response to the fact that prisons are intended, among other things, to emasculate inmates. ... This book is a call to arms to not only re-examine the oppressive structures of prison, but to look at prisons as a microcosm of a society that has perverted the definition of manhood, so that it has come to oppress not only women, but men as well."</I>
