<P><p>As America’s most ethnically diverse foreign-born population, Asian
Americans can puzzle political observers. This volume’s multidisciplinary
team of contributors employ a variety of methodologies&#151
including quantitative, ethnographic, and historical&#151to illustrate how
transnational ties between the U.S. and Asia have shaped, and are increasingly
defining, Asian American politics in our multicultural society.</p><p>
Original essays by U.S.- and Asian-based scholars discuss
Cambodian, Chinese, Filipino, Indian, Japanese, Korean, and
Vietnamese communities from Boston to Honolulu. The volume also
shows how the grassroots activism of America's "newest minority"
both reflects and is instrumental in broader processes of political
change throughout the Pacific. Addressing the call for more global
approaches to racial and ethnic politics, contributors describe how
Asian immigrants strategically navigate the hurdles to domestic
incorporation and equality by turning their political sights and
energies toward Asia. These essays convincingly demonstrate that
Asian American political participation in the U.S. does not consist
simply of domestic actions with domestic ends.</p><p>

<p><i>"Bookended by two historical case studies, and filled in between with original studies on political behavior of diverse new Asian immigrant communities, </i>The Transnational Politics of Asian Americans<i> further elucidates the characteristics of Asian American political participation and activism in the U.S. This fine volume poses the question of whether transnational political behavior ultimately advances Asian incorporation into an increasingly multicultural and globalized America." </i><br>&#151<b>Evelyn Hu-DeHart</b>, Professor of History and Ethnic Studies, Director, Center for the Studies of Race and Ethnicity in America, Brown University

<P><I>"Editors Christian Collet and Pei-te Lien provide a succinct summary of the development of the concept of transnationalism and a useful overview of the debate over the concept.... The editors have done an excellent job of highlighting the widely ranging ways that transnationalism can operate.... This collection makes a valuable contribution to our understanding of the political behavior of today’s immigrants, and it suggests that there is much continuity underlying the substantial change that immigrants bring to America."</i><br><b>&#151<i>Perspective on Politics</i></b>

<P><I>"This collection of essays combines historical analyses and current accounts of transnational politics among a variety of Asian-American ethnic groups: Cambodians, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Filipino, Indian, and Vietnamese.  It is a must for any library on ethnic studies…. [M]any of the essays on specific groups are the best written and most informative, especially the excellent pieces on Japanese Americans by Eiichiro Azuma on how Japanese Americans in California in the 1910s sought aid from the Japanese government and Japanese businessmen to counter the nativist campaign in California."</i><br> <b>&#151<i>Multicultural Review</i></b>

<p><I>"</I>The Transnational Politics of Asian Americans<I> offers the reader a critical insight into the political behavior and distinctly transnational context of the Asian American electorate.... As Collet and Lien make trenchantly clear, Asian Americans often, if not always, make political choices that are affected by a fluid, constantly moving dynamic that involves up-to-the-minute geopolitical considerations (through the virtual community) and political economies of both homeland and diaspora operating—as the people themselves do—in constant flux (between Asia/Pacific and the U.S.)." </I><br>&#151<b> <I>Journal of American Ethnic History</I></b>

<p><I>"[A] valuable addition to the ways we think about political participation, identity formation, and the nation–state itself during a time of rapid transition. It is to the editors’ credit that they gather a wide range of approaches and link historians and cultural studies scholars with those in the social sciences. Collet and Lien have compiled an invaluable guide to the rapidly changing politics of our contemporary moment." </I><br>&#151<b> <I>Journal of Transnational American Studies</I></b>

</p><p>Founded by Sucheng Chan in 1991, the <I>Asian American History and Culture</I>, series has sponsored innovative scholarship that has redefined, expanded, and advanced the field of Asian American studies while strengthening its links to related areas of scholarly inquiry and engaged critique. Like the field from which it emerged, the series remains rooted in the social sciences and humanities, encompassing multiple regions, formations, communities, and identities. Extending the vision of founding editor Sucheng Chan and emeriti editor Michael Omi and David Palumbo-Liu, series editors K. Scott Wong, Linda Trinh Võ, and Cathy Schlund-Vials continue to develop a foundational collection that embodies a range of theoretical and methodological approaches to Asian American studies.</p>
