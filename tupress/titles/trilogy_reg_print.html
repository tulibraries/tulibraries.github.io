This important book provides the catalyst for us to learn, to speak, to ponder, and to find a common voice. It is a new starting point for ecumenical understanding and modeling unity to institutions of learning."</I>

<BR><H2 class="inpageheading">Reviews</h2><p>
<p><I>"First published in German, this English translation has a twofold aim: first, it is an introduction to the social ethical thinking of the three major Christian traditions; second, it demonstrates that the different approaches complement each other – while at the same time providing ample material for clarifying various issues within each of the traditions and among them. In this way the book takes an important step toward enhancing ecumenical cooperation in ethical responsibilities in society, mapping out common ground for practical cooperation."</I>
<br>&#151<b>Kurt Cardinal Koch</b>, President of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity

<p><I>"This volume takes a long view of the European condition, rather than addressing the contemporary crisis. The authors unfold three pathways of Christian moral reasoning that shape Christian approaches and responses to the needs of any time or place. In this way, Christian social ethics as presented in the chapters on Orthodox, Catholic, and Protestant thought are shown to be relevant to a wide variety of contexts. Thus, the English translation of this textbook provides an excellent resource for all scholars and students of social ethics."</I><br>&#151<b>Rev. Dr. Olav Fykse Tveit</b>, General Secretary, World Council of Churches
