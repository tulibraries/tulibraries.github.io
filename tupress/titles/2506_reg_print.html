	<BLOCKQUOTE><p><i>&#8203;"Michael Smerconish is the rare political observer who can get pumped up over important, weighty subjects like gerrymandering and closed primaries. He's a post-partisan problem solver who is trying to restore sanity to the political process. If only more of the country could be as passionate as Smerconish about the need for change, we could end partisan gridlock and get our politicians working for the people again. I have always believed in Dwight D. Eisenhower's wisdom that the center of the road is the only usable space and the extreme left and right are the gutters, and </i>Clowns to the Left of Me, Jokers to the Right <i>says this perfectly. It's an entertaining collection of 100 of his engaging newspaper columns written in a post-9/11 world, each followed by a new Afterword. Fire up a stogie and enjoy this book, knowing that as you're getting wiser, your support will help benefit the Children's Crisis Treatment Center."<br>&#8212;</i><b>Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger</b><br></BLOCKQUOTE>
	
	<P><p>Opinionated talk show host and columnist Michael Smerconish has been chronicling local, state, and national events for the <i>Philadelphia Daily News </i>and the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer </i>for more than 15 years. He has sounded off on topics as diverse as the hunt for Osama bin Laden and what the color of your Christmas lights says about you. In this collection of 100 of his most memorable columns, Smerconish reflects on American political life with his characteristic feistiness. With a new Afterword for each column, the author provides updates on both facts and feelings, indicating how he has evolved over the years, moving from a conservative political perspective to having more of a centrist view. <P> <i>Clowns to the Left of Me, Jokers to the Right </i>covers the post-9/11 years, Barack Obama's ascension, and the rise of Donald Trump. Smerconish also recounts meeting Ronald Reagan, having dinner with Fidel Castro, and barbequing with the band YES in his backyard, as well as spending the same night with Pete Rose and Ted Nugent, drinking champagne from the Stanley Cup, and conducting Bill Cosby's only pre-trial interview. Additionally, he writes about local Philadelphia culture, from Sid Mark to the Rizzo statue.<P>Smerconish's outlook as expressed in these impassioned opinion pieces goes beyond "liberal" or "conservative." His thought process continues to evolve and change, and as it does, he aims to provoke readers to do the same.   <P><i>All author proceeds benefit the Children's Crisis Treatment Center</i><br>
