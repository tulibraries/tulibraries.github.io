</P><p>Want to walk for a leisurely hour or two with the kids? Take them to the Churchville Nature Center, with its re-created Lenape Indian village and children's exhibits. Or would you prefer a more strenuous all-day hike? Try the rocky woods trail at Bake Oven Knob, Bear Rocks, and The Cliffs. Are your interests historical? Visit the more than fifty pre-Revolutionary dwellings at Skippack Creek. Or if you're interested in wildlife, hike Green Lane Reservoir, where 260 species of birds have been sighted. Perhaps you'd simply like to hike from Pennsylvania to Delaware and back again. Then White Clay Creek Preserve is for you.

<p>These are only five of the forty hiking trails described in <i>Hikes Around Philadelphia. </i>All are within an hour and a half's drive of the city. Ranging from 1.0 to 12.6 miles in length, they will take you through dense forests or wide-open meadows, past early farmsteads or a ringing boulder field from the last ice age. You can break your hike with a visit to a restored home or leave civilization behind on an isolated mountain ridge. Some of the trails are gravel or paved, or are canal towpaths, and are quite suitable for young children, older adults, or wheelchair hikers. Others are longer and more challenging, including rugged sections of the Appalachian Trail and the Horseshoe Trail.

<p>For each hike Boyd Newman and Linda Newman provide a detailed write-up, a trail map, and directions to the trailhead. They also include information on distance, elevation, probable hike time, surface, interesting features, facilities, disability access, whether hunting is allowed in the vicinity, and availability to public transportation. This format allows you to browse through the book and easily locate the particular hike that appeals to you today.

<p>In a concise introduction, the authors not only explain how to get the most out of the book but also give some hints on hiking safety and appropriate clothing and equipment.
