<p><i>The Teacherï¿½s Attention</i> is a fresh take on relationships in schools.
Looking beyond our obsession with raising test scores, this book
recognizes that education is a key partner in raising children. Garrett
Delavan contends that allowing students, educators and parents to
navigate a smaller number of relationships&#151a concept he calls
"relationship load"&#151provides many benefits, including a better
chance at achieving equal access to a good education for all children.</p><p>
Delavan shows how class size, school size, and longer-term student-teacher relationships are all equally critical components for educating our children ethically and successfully. After examining these proposed reforms in detail, Delavan also considers counterarguments and provides a detailed projection of costs and savings,
putting to rest the assumption that smaller classes and smaller schools
are necessarily more expensive. Finally, the book discusses possible
steps toward implementation, showing how the author's proposed
reforms are remarkably practical.</p>

<BR>&nbsp;<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p><i>"Delavan's text advocates smaller sized schools and classes. His proposal is based on both personal research and experience. He asks readers to rethink what kids really need....Delavan admits that his notions are idealistic, but that 'future adults' are worth the sacrifice. Recommended." </I><br>&#151<b><i>Choice</b></i>

<p><i>"If ever there has been a book that makes the case for smaller class sizes, this is it. It looks not only at policy issues, costs, and political strategies, but also pushes educators and parents to think about our relationships with students. Delavan, a high school teacher in Salt Lake City, argues for 'relationship load' reduction as a key feature of improving education and the lives of children." </I><br>&#151<b><i>Rethinking Schools Online</b></i>
