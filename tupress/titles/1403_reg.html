</P><p>This new reality&#151the Latinization of the United States&#151is driven by forces that reach well beyond U.S. borders. It asserts itself demographically, politically, in the workplace, and in daily life. The perception that Latinos are now positioned to help bring about change in the Americas from within the United States has taken hold, sparking renewed interest and specific initiatives by hemispheric governments to cultivate new forms of relationships with emigrant communities. 

<p><I>Borderless Borders</I> describes the structural processes and active interventions taking place inside and outside U.S. Latino communities. After a context-setting introduction by urban planner Rebecca Morales, the contributors focus on four themes. Economist Manuel Pastor Jr., urban sociologist Saskia Sassen, and political scientist Carol Wise look at emerging forms of global and transnational  interdependence and at whether they are likely to produce individuals who are economically independent or simply more dependent. Sociologist Jorge Chapa, social anthropologist Maria P. Fernández Kelly, and economist Edwin Meléndez examine the negative impact of economic and political restructuring within the United States, especially within Latino communities. Performance artist Guillermo Gomez-Peña, legal scholar Gerald Torres, political scientist María de los Angeles Torres, and modern language specialist  Silvio Torres-Saillant consider the implications&#151for community formation, citizenship, political participation, and human rights&#151of the fact that individuals are forced to construct identities for themselves in more than one sociopolitical setting. Finally, sociologist Jeremy Brecher, sociologist Frank Bonilla, and political scientist Pedro Cabán speculate on new paths into international relations and issue-oriented social movements and organizations among these mobile populations. To supplement the written contributions, painter Bibiana Suárez has chosen several artworks that contribute to the interdisciplinary scope of the book.
