<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>"This is an interesting and diverse collection that bridges
several divides: between scholars and activists, culture and politics, and European and U.S. theoretical perspectives.  Together, the chapters give a good picture of the complexities of contemporary social movements, cultural politics, identity and the politicization of personal realms, and the legacy of the movements of the 1960s.  It will make a valuable contribution to contemporary intellectual and political thought."</I>

<P><p>Bridging the worlds of activism and academia-social movement theory informed with the real experiences of activists-this volume of accessible essays brings together insights from European New Social Movement theorists, U.S. scholars of social movements, and activists involved in social movements from the 1960s to the 1990s.</p>
<BR><H2 class="inpageheading">Excerpt</h2><P>Excerpt available at <a href="http://www.temple.edu/tempress">www.temple.edu/tempress</a></p>
<p>"Like so much else about social movements, the meaning of the term is itself often hotly contested.  For us, social movements are collective efforts by socially and politically subordinated people to challenge the conditions and assumptions of their lives.  These efforts are a distinctive sort of social activity: collective action becomes a "movement" when participants refuse to accept the boundaries of established institutional rules and routinized roles.  Single instances of such popular defiance don't make a movement; the term refers to persistent, patterned, and widely distributed collective challenges to the status quo.

<p>"While traditional definitions usually focus on movement challenges to political structures, economic arrangements, and institutional rules, social movements&#151perhaps especially contemporary ones&#151also take on established cultural categories and social identities.  Accordingly, social movements appear to be simultaneously spontaneous and strategic, expressive (of emotion and need) and instrumental (seeking some concrete ends), unruly and organized, political and cultural.  The seeming contradictoriness of movement activity therefore challenges not only political systems and cultural status quos but also many of our explanatory frameworks and analytic categories.  When social movements are surging, both social order and social theory are called into question."
