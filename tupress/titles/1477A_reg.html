<p><i>Tutoring Matters</i> is the authoritative guide for both the aspiring and seasoned tutor. Using firsthand experiences of over one hundred new and experienced college student tutors, the authors offer techniques for handling tutoring anxieties, teaching strategies, and tips for building relationships.

<p>This new edition has been fully updated to help tutors to engage the interest of their students. In addition, it features practical �tip boxes�  that provide quick-reference guidelines on a range of tutoring challenges&#8212;from making a connection in your first tutoring session to becoming familiar with your pupil's life and tutoring needs. This new edition also provides practical experience-based tips "from the trenches" about how to tutor math and reading and how to help students develop other academic skills and interests.
