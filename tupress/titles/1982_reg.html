</P><BLOCKQUOTE><I>“Freedom is a key philosophical idea that is taken seriously in this book. Importantly, freedom is also an idea that is intrinsically interesting to students. The author pulls students into the text by inviting them to view their own status as free agents and as critical thinkers.”</I>
<BR>&#151<B>Richard (Mort) Morehouse</B>, Viterbo University<I></I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>Thinking Your Way to Freedom</I> is a critical-thinking textbook with a difference. Rather than focusing exclusively on improving college students’ academic achievement, Susan Gardner seeks to dramatically change how students think through issues that are important in their lives beyond school. Gardner created 66 original and entertaining comic strips—featuring her dogs, Diva and Ben—that add a light touch as they encourage intellectual and personal autonomy. Through a clear step-by-step method of practical reasoning, students are taught how to think impartially and how to neutralize invisible biases that limit their freedom of thought and action. With the help of Diva and Ben, readers learn to evaluate the strengths of arguments and to recognize fallacies, all the while avoiding the paralyzing effects of relativism.</P>

<p><i>Thinking Your Way to Freedom</i> includes the writing of short essays so that students can improve their critical thinking and writing at the same time. </P>

<BR>&nbsp;<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p><i>"Gardner places a critical thinking course in the context of a normative philosophy of human freedom and moral autonomy. She argues that human beings should learn to think well, not merely in order to be successful but to realize their potential as human beings. Gardner's tone is lively, personable and engaging, and </i>Thinking Your Way to Freedom<i> is coherent and persuasive."</i>
