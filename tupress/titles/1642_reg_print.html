<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>"This excellent collection of essays on the New Left helps mark the coming of age of a rising generation of scholars, too young to have experienced the 1960s but committed to bringing new scholarly questions to the study of the decade."</I>
<br>&#151<b>Alan Brinkley</b>, Columbia University, and author of <I>Liberalism and Its Discontents</I><I></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><p>Starting with the premise that it is possible to say something significantly new about the 1960s and the New Left, the contributors to this volume trace the social roots, the various paths, and the legacies of the movement that set out to change America. As members of a younger generation of scholars, none of them (apart from Paul Buhle) has first-hand knowledge of the era. Their perspective as non-participants enables them to offer fresh interpretations of the regional and ideological differences that have been obscured in the standard histories and memoirs of the period. Reflecting the diversity of goals, the clashes of opinions, and the tumult of the time, these essays will engage seasoned scholars as well as students of the '60s.</p>

<BR><H2 class="inpageheading">Reviews</h2><p>
<p><I>"From 'Was the New Left new?'  to 'Did the New Left die and if so, why?' to 'What was the role of women in the draft resistance movement?' with a dozen case studies by a new generation of leftist scholars, this amazing collection asks new questions and sparkles with new insights and brilliance on every page."</I>
<br>&#151<b>Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz</b>, Professor in Ethnic Studies and Women's Studies, California State University

<p><I>"You'll be amazed at how much you think you know about the Sixties is wrong&#151especially if you've read the standard works on the subject. This is an agenda-setting anthology, adventurous and rigorous in equal measure."</I>
<br>&#151<b>Rick Perlstein</b>, author of <I>Before the Storm: Barry Goldwater and the Unmaking of the American Consensus</I>

<p><i>"This impressive collection of essays re-examining the "New Left" movements of the 1960s is written by a new generation of scholars detached from the events they are recounting. ...This welcome collection challenges the pessimism of former radicals and exposes the opportunism of "the second God that failed," ex-activists turned conservatives. ... An outstanding collection. Summing Up: Essential."</i>
<br>&#151<b><i>Choice</i></b>

<p><i>"Well, this is an interesting book for us old fogies who work on the social movements of the 1960s! ...the book as a whole is provocative and fascinating, reshaping our understanding of the new left, democratizing it, perhaps."</i>
<br>&#151<b><i>The American Journal of Sociology</i></b>

<p><i>"</i>New Left Revisited<i> succeeds admirably...the volume as a whole is a rich repast, for professional historians and lay readers alike."</i>
<br>&#151<b><i>Labor/Le Travail</i></b>

<p><i>"Is there anything left to be said about the New Left? The answer is a resounding yes.... John McMillian's useful introduction and Paul Buhle's inspired concluding ruminations provide bookends for twelve original and insightful essays.... Consonant with the best impulses of social history, </i>The New Left Revisited<i> offers detailed, textured, and nuanced accounts of New Left radicalism..."</i>
<br>&#151<b><i>New England Quarterly</i></b>

<p><i>"Taken together [these essays] create a picture of the New Left as a complex dynamic movement where the socialization of the existing society was challenged by new ideas of what was possible.... an enjoyable, thought-provoking read."</i>
<br>&#151<b><i>Socialism and Democracy Online</I></b>

<p><i>"...an exciting anthology..."</i>
<br>&#151<b><i>The Journal of American History</i></b>

</p><p><i>Critical Perspectives on the Past</i>, edited by Susan Porter Benson, Stephen Brier, and Roy Rosenzweig, is concerned with the traditional and nontraditional ways in which historical ideas are formed.  In its attentiveness to issues of race, class, and gender and to the role of human agency in shaping events, the series is as critical of traditional historical method as content.  Emphasizing that history is itself an interpretation of material events, the series demonstrates that the historian's choices of subject, narrative technique, and documentation are politically as well as intellectually constructed.</p>
