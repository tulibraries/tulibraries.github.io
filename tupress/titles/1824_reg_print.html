<br>&#151<b>Robert G. Lee</b>, Associate Professor of American Civilization, Brown University, and author of <i>Orientals</i> (Temple)<i></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><p><i>Chinese American Transnationalism</i> considers the many ways in which Chinese living in the United States during the exclusion era maintained ties with China through a constant interchange of people and economic resources, as well as political and cultural ideas. This book continues the exploration of the exclusion era begun in two previous volumes: <i>Entry Denied</i>, which examines the strategies that Chinese Americans used to protest, undermine, and circumvent the exclusion laws; and <i>Claiming America</i>, which traces the development of Chinese American ethnic identities. Taken together, the three volumes underscore the complexities of the Chinese immigrant experience and the ways in which its contexts changed over the sixty-one year period.</p>

<BR><H2 class="inpageheading">Reviews</h2><p>
<p><i>"</i>Chinese American Transnationalism<i> contains fresh and original contributions, highlighting the long history of transnationalism in Chinese American history. Though Chinese exclusion laws tried to curb Chinese immigration to the United States, the authors of this excellent volume demonstrate that people, ideas, cultural and political practices, and economic resources continued to migrate back and forth across the Pacific. Despite significant legal obstacles, Chinese Americans created vibrant communities with complex ties to both China and the United States."</i>
<br>&#151<b>Lucy E. Salyer</b>, University of New Hampshire

<p><i>"</i>Chinese American Transnationalism<i> flows particularly well from Chan's last volume, </i>Claiming America<i>. Her introduction is gracefully written and does an impressive job of tying together the chapters in the anthology, showing how each connects in a different way with the general theme of Chinese immigrants' desire to maintain cultural and material ties with their country of origin. There is something interesting and valuable to be learned from every one of the individual essays, and together, they throw significant new light on the experience of the Chinese American community during the exclusion era."</i>
<br>&#151<b>Charles McClain</b>, Jurisprudence and Social Policy Program, School of Law, University of California, Berkeley

<p><i>"This invigorating anthology completes a trilogy...[the] rich approaches underscore how this era of limitation and prejudice also witnessed significant resistance, creativity, and Chinese growth across national boundaries. Recommended."</i>
<br>&#151;<b><i>Choice</i></b>

<p>"Chinese American Transnationalism<i> thus brings together in one volume exemplary work based on multilingual sources, methodological rigor, and conceptual innovation. It sets a very high bar for a trend that risks slipping into academic faddism.</i>"
<br>&#151;<b><i>The Journal of American History.</i></b>

<p><i>"Taken together, these essays offer a concise and worthwhile introduction to the state of the field in Chinese American social history."</i>
<br>&#151;<b><i>Western Historical Quarterly</i></b>

<p><i>"Immigrant experience is no longer a one-way street to the Promised Land but a multifaceted process that involves migration, return migration and re-migration. </i>Chinese American Transnationalism<i> serves as a model example of this new scholarship�. Chan should be commended for continuing to produce solid scholarship in Asian American history. For this particular volume, I would certainly concur with her statement, �If faculty teaching Chinese American or, more broadly, Asian American [history] can choose only one book about the exclusion era to assign in their classes, this book is it.� (p. x)."</i><br>&#151;<b><i>Pacific Historical Review</i></b>
