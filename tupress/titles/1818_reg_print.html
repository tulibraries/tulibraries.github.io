Westcott covers virtually every aspect of the stadium's 33 years&#151from its conception, and construction, interviews with more than 125 people for whom the Vet was a prominent part of their professional and personal lives, and the two primary tenants of the stadium, Phillies baseball and Eagles football. </i>Veterans Stadium<i> is a special piece of historic nostalgia and it will be of significant interest to the sports-book reading public."</i>
<br>&#151<b>Bob Bloss</b>, author of <i><a href="1716_reg.html" target="_top">Rookies of the Year</a></i><i></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><p>Veterans Stadium was the outdoor sports and concert capital of Philadelphia from 1971 until its televised demolition in 2004. At its best, "The Vet" spawned two of the greatest moments in the city's sports history&#151Tug McGraw's 1980 strikeout of Willie Wilson to win the World Series and the Eagles thrashing of the Dallas Cowboys to clinch their first Super Bowl bid. At its worst, it saw fans pelt Santa Claus with snowballs and the opening of an in-stadium branch of Philadelphia municipal court to deal with rowdy Eagles fans.

<p>Part of a look-alike generation of all-purpose stadiums erected around the country, the Vet took on its own personality over the years. For all its deficiencies, it left fans loving it in the way they loved their own families&#151warts and all. Almost 100 photographs and Rich Westcott's yarns make <i>Veterans Stadium</i> the one book that will help Philadelphians&#151and Philadelphia visitors&#151remember thirty years of their history.</p>
