</P><BLOCKQUOTE><I>"<i>For Redskins fans, this book is a treasure-trove of stories, facts, anecdotes and quotes ... It's as detailed as a Joe Gibbs game plan, as far-reaching as a Jurgensen to Taylor post pattern, and as enjoyable as a victory over the Cowboys!</i></i>"<br>&#151<b>Steve Sabol</b>, President of NFL Films</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>"Hail to the Redskins" and Redskin-mania have consumed the nation's capital since 1937, the Redskins' first year in Washington. And the fervor remains as strong, if not stronger, today. 
<p>
Amply illustrated with 200 photos of players, coaches, and fans, <i>The Redskins Encyclopedia</i> recounts the franchise's first 75 seasons, re-living the great-and not so great-moments in the team's storied history, and the men who helped make Sundays memorable. 
<p>
Fans will read about: 
<p>
*Coaches like George Allen, the eccentric, passionate man who left a legacy as an NFL pioneer, and Joe Gibbs, who formed a D-Y-N-A-S-T-Y.
<p>
*Players like star running back and all-time Redskins ground-gainer John Riggins, who once memorably told Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor to "loosen up, Sandy baby," and Doug Williams, the first starting black quarterback to win a Super Bowl and Super Bowl MVP honors.
<p>
*The franchise's golden run of four Super Bowl appearances-and three wins-in the 1980s and early 1990s
<p>
*The legendary Redskins-Cowboys rivalry
<p>
But wait, there's more-<i>The Redskins Encyclopedia</i> also includes:
<p>
*A year by year history of the team-from 1932 to the present, with stats from each season
<p>
*Individual profiles of more than 100 Redskins players-from Sammy Baugh to Darrell Green to Art Monk to Sonny Jurgensen to Charley Taylor to Joe Theismann
<p>
*A statistical chapter that provides all of the Redskins records-a complete roster and every draft pick
<p>
With an unparalleled collection of anecdotes, quotes, trivia, and hard-to-find information, <i>The Redskins Encyclopedia</i> is a must-have book for any fan who has ever bled burgundy and gold.
