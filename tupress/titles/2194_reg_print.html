Chuck Finder has woven together a crystalline presentation of Steelers lore that will draw in even the most casual fan.  For the Steelers' maniacal fandom, these stories and quotes are a can�t�put�down gathering of Black and Gold facts representing the good and bad about the most endearing pro sports franchise. Go Steelers!"</I><br>&#151<b>Bill Hillgrove</b>, Play-By-Play, Pittsburgh Steelers <I></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><P>The pitiful Pittsburgh Pirates, established in 1933 by the inimitable "Chief," Art Rooney Sr. defied both belief and the odds by becoming the six-time Super Bowl champions that the Pittsburgh Steelers are today. They began as the woebegone Pirates, then degenerated into the Same Old Steelers, the Steagles, and the Car-Pitts, but wound up one of professional sports' most iconic franchises. 

<p>In <i>The Steelers Encyclopedia</i>, veteran sportswriter Chuck Finder nimbly chronicles this remarkable team from conception to Immaculate Reception to today. From turnovers to the Terrible Towel, Finder interviews nearly 100 ex-Steelers, coaches, front-office personnel, and fans, and includes more than 150 photographs&#8212;many of them never published before. 

<p>In <i>The Steelers Encyclopedia</i>, fans will read about wild behind-the-scenes tales such as:

<ul><li><p>	Jack Lambert, the gap-toothed linebacker considered the game's scariest player, screaming down a hallway clad in his undies, boots, and cowboy hat because he was afraid of a teammate's prank snake

<li><p>	One Super Bowl team making an unscheduled pit stop because they, um, imbibed too many celebratory refreshments after leaving the stadium

<li><p>	Driving with the club's legendary founding father, Art Rooney Sr., to his day job&#8212;the horse track</ul> 

<p>Get a look at the stars, the games, and the franchise:

<ul><li><p>	New details about the Rooneys, the sale of their team, the difficult times and decisions they faced in surviving, then thriving

<li><p>	Characters ranging from bonus-baby Byron "Whizzer" White, a future U.S. Supreme Court Justice, to league MVPs Bill Dudley and Terry Bradshaw

<li><p>The parade of Hall of Fame ex-Steelers that continues in 2012 with Dermontti Dawson and Jack Butler . . . and includes one Canton honoree who was almost moved to a different position and another whose career took off upon ditching his glasses for contacts

<li><p>	The man who wrote the Steelers polka, the kid who named the Steel Curtain, and the first weightlifting coach of the Super Steelers

<li><p>	The nasal voice that provided the team's historic soundtrack and belonged to the inventor of the Terrible Towel, Myron Cope</ul>

<p>Learn the Steelers by the numbers:

<ul><li><p>	A year-by-year history of the team from 1933 to the present, with stats from each season

<li><p>	Chapters about each Super Bowl and the scouting staff responsible for building champions, including tales from inside the draft war room

<li><p>	Individual profiles of every Steelers head coach and more than 100 Steelers players&#8212;from Jerome Bettis to Rod Woodson

<li><p>The cheerleaders&#8212;both female and male</ul>

<p>For everyone who lives in Steeler Nation, this is the most comprehensive history of football's most beloved franchise, the Black and Gold.
