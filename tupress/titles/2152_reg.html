<P><i>The Borders of Justice</i> investigates the complexities of transitional justice that emerge from its �social embeddedness.�  This original collection of essays, which stem from a collective research program on social justice undertaken by the Calcutta Research Group, confronts the concept and practices of justice. The editors and contributors question the relationship between geography, methodology, and justice�how and why justice is meted out differently in different places. Expanding on Michael Walzer's idea of the �spheres of justice,� the contributors argue that justice is burdened with our notions of social realities and expectations, in addition to the influence of money, law, and government.
