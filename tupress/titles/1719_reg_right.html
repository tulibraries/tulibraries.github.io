<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>"Rich Westcott's breezy writing is chock full of quirky anecdotes. He is at his best when he's unearthing such gems as those about Aloysius Travers, a St. Joseph's College student manager, who pitched one game for Detroit...'the 24-2 loss might have had something to do with Travers's decision to become a priest.' </i>Native Sons<i> should be of interest to longtime Philadelphia baseball fans and his loyal audience of readers won't be disappointed."</i>

<p>Reggie Jackson (Wyncote). Roy Campanella (Philadelphia). Pat Kelly (also Philadelphia). From the most famous to the little known, 350 major league baseball players came from the Philadelphia area. Now, for the first time, celebrated baseball historian Rich Westcott brings these "native sons" home.

<p>In this short book, Westcott offers profiles of some of the most celebrated, talented, and often just hardest-working athletes to ever lift a bat and glove in major league baseball. He tells of the athletes like Mr. October, who were born here and went away, and others, like Kensington-born Jimmie Wilson, who became a star in his own hometown. Throughout <i>Native Sons</i>, Westcott recounts the startling careers of some incredible players, and recreates for readers the magical place they all called home.

<P><p><i>"</i>Native Sons<i> again demonstrates Rich Westcott's skills as one of major league baseball's outstanding historians. For the first time, Westcott has compiled a complete, well-documented, vividly written account of every player and manager who was born in the Philadelphia area and realized the dream of making it to the big leagues. They're all here&#151;from Cal Abrams to Bert Yeabsley, as well as many of the significant records and lively anecdotes that have helped make the City of Brotherly Love such a colorful part of our National Pastime."</i>
<br>&#151<b>Robert S. Lyons</b>, author of <i><a href="1622_reg.html" target="_top">Palestra Pandemonium: A History of the Big 5</a></i>

<p><i>"Another fine effort by one of baseball's top historians. Filled with information about players you have heard about, grew up with, or are still currently playing. From MVPs to those who only played one inning, if they're from the area, they're in this book."</i>
<br>&#151<b>Jack Scheuer</b>, Associated Press Correspondent who has covered local sports for over 35 years

<p><I>"Chock full of human interest stories only an insider would know...this is definitely a must read for the Hot Stove League. Get your copy pronto."</I>
