Activists at National and many other U.S. airlines sought to win political power and material resources for people who live beyond the boundary of the traditional family. In<i> Deregulating Desire</i>, Ryan Patrick Murphy, a former flight attendant himself, chronicles the efforts of single women, unmarried parents, lesbians and gay men, as well as same-sex couples to make the airline industry a crucible for social change in the decades after 1970.<br><p>Murphy situates the flight attendant union movement in the history of debates about family and work. Each chapter offers an economic and a cultural analysis to show how the workplace has been the primary venue to enact feminist and LGBTQ politics.<br><p>From the political economic consequences of activism to the dynamics that facilitated the rise of what Murphy calls the "family values economy" to the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, <i>Deregulating Desire</i> emphasizes the enduring importance of social justice for flight attendants in the twenty-first century.<br><P CLASS="top"><A HREF="#top">BACK TO TOP</A></P><P><h2  class="inpageheading"><A NAME="excerpt"></a>Excerpt</h2><p><A HREF="http://www.temple.edu/tempress/chapters_1800/2255_ch1.pdf">Read the Introduction (pdf).</A><br><P CLASS="top"><A HREF="#top">BACK TO TOP</A></P></P><P><h2  class="inpageheading"><A NAME="reviews"></a>Reviews</h2><p>"<i>Bravo!&nbsp;Murphy's pioneering study captures the exuberance and courage of post-1960s flight attendants as they struggle for sexual equity and economic justice.&nbsp;By&nbsp;embracing the diverse desires and intimate relations of all workers,&nbsp;Deregulating Desire&nbsp;models a new affective labor history, as attentive to feelings as to economic self-interest</i>."<br>&#8212;<b>Dorothy Sue Cobble</b>, Distinguished Professor of History and Labor Studies, Rutgers University, and co-author of <i>Feminism Unfinished: A Short, Surprising History of American Women's Movements</i><br><p>"<i>Ryan Patrick Murphy crafts a wholly innovative, interdisciplinary approach to the study of post-1970s trade unionism, placing the history of flight attendant activism alongside that of the women's movement and LGBT politics.
