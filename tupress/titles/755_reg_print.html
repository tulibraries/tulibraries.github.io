</P></td></tr></table><BR><P><p>Since the 1960's, academic and activist women have been challenging the conventional wisdom about political life and the study of politics. Organizing her book by standard political concepts&#151the mobilization and participation of the mass public; the recruitment, policy preferences, and political style of public officials; agenda-setting; and coalition-building&#151Janet Flammang subjects these concepts to a withering feminist critique based on the insights of feminist theory and the empirical evidence of hundreds of studies of women's distinctive politics.

<p>This book accomplishes four major tasks:<br>
<ul><li><p>It provides a comprehensive critical history of the changing research on politics and the changing nature of the political science discipline.
<li><p>It analyzes the course of women's political activism in the United States.
<li><p>It develops a rich case study of women's politics in Northern California's Silicon Valley, an area once nicknamed "the feminist capital of the nation."
<li><p>It examines coalitions and divisions within the women's movement with sensitivity to minority politics, as in the chapter subtitled, "The Hard Work of Sisterhood."</ul>

<p><i>Women's Political Voice </i>records the transformative politics of the women's movement and, simultaneously, urges political scientists to ask new questions and to adopt new methods.</p>
