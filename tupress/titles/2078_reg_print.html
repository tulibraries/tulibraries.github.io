The bittersweet emotions she had are shared in Asian American literature that depicts migration-related melancholia, contests official histories, and portrays Asian American families as flexible and transpacific. <i> </i><br/><br/> <i>Where I Have Never Been </i>explores the tropes of return, tracing both literal return visits by Asian emigrants and symbolic "returns": first visits by diasporic offspring. Chu argues that these Asian American narratives seek to remedy widely held anxieties about cultural loss and the erasure of personal and family histories from public memory. In fiction, memoirs, and personal essays, the writers of return narratives-including novelists Lisa See, May-lee Chai, Lydia Minatoya, and Ruth Ozeki, and best-selling author Denise Chong, diplomat Yung Wing, scholar Winberg Chai, essayist Josephine Khu, and many others-register and respond to personal and family losses through acts of remembrance and countermemory. <i> </i><br/><br/>In the series <i>Asian American History and Culture, </i>edited by Cathy Schlund-Vials, Rick Bonus, and Shelley Sang-Hee Lee.

Like the field from which it emerged, the series remains rooted in the social sciences and humanities, encompassing multiple regions, formations, communities, and identities. Extending the vision of founding editor Sucheng Chan and emeriti editor Michael Omi, David Palumbo-Liu, K. Scott Wong and Linda Trinh VÃµ, series editors Cathy Schlund-Vials, Rick Bonus, and Shelley Sang-Hee Lee continue to develop a foundational collection that embodies a range of theoretical and methodological approaches to Asian American studies.</p></P></P></P><P>&nbsp;</P><font face="Arial" size="1"><a href="copyright.html" OnMouseOver="window.status='Web Copyright Policy';return true;" OnMouseOut="window.status=''" TITLE="Web Copyright Policy">&copy;</a> 2019 <a href="http://www.temple.edu" target="new" OnMouseOver="window.status='Link to Temple University home page';return true;" OnMouseOut="window.status=''" TITLE="Link to Temple University home page">Temple University</a>.
