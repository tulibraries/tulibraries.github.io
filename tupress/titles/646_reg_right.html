<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>"For both academic analysts and political activists, this book offers useful lessons from the Polish experience with anti-politics and neocorporatism."</I>
<br>&#151<b><I>Political Science Quarterly</I></b><I></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Based on extensive use of primary sources, this book provides an analysis of Solidarity, from its ideological origins in the Polish "new left," through the dramatic revolutionary months of 1980-81, and up to the union�s remarkable resurgence in 1988-89, when it sat down with the government to negotiate Poland�s future. David Ost focuses on what Solidarity is trying to accomplish and why it is likely that the movement will succeed. 

<p>He traces the conflict between the ruling Communist Party and the opposition, Solidarity�s response to it, and the resulting reforms. Noting that Poland is the one country in the world where "radicals of �68" came to be in a position to negotiate with a government about the nature of the political system, Ost asks what Poland tells us about the possibility for realizing a "new left" theory of democracy in the modern world. 

<p>As a Fulbright Fellow at Warsaw University and Polish correspondent for the weekly newspaper <I>In These Times</I> during the Solidarity uprising and a frequent visitor to Poland since then, David Ost has had access to a great deal of unpublished material on the labor movement. Without dwelling on the familiar history of August 1980, he offers some of the unfamiliar subtleties&#151such as the significance of the Szczecin as opposed to the Gdansk Accord&#151and shows how they shaped the budding union�s understanding of the conflicts ahead. Unique in its attention to the critical, formative period following August 1980, this study is the most current and comprehensive analysis of a movement that continues to transform the nature of East European society.

<P><p><I>"In his superb book, ...political scientist David Ost chronicles the trajectory of the Polish post-war opposition from its roots in the fascist resistance up to the actions of Solidarity in 19.... [He] astutely bridges academic disciplines, interweaving social theory with intellectual and political history to explain Solidarity's raison d'etre.... In an age when definitions of left and right have become obscured, </I>Solidarity and the Politics of Anti-Politics<I> stands out at a creative example of left thought."</I>
