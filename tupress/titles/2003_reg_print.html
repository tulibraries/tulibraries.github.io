Theatre and Film Studies at the University of Georgia, and
author of <i>Hitler�s Heroines: Stardom and Womanhood in
Nazi Cinema</i> (Temple)</p></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><p>Postwar America imagined itself young and in love in Europe. And Hollywood films of the era reflected this romantic allure. From a young and na�ve Audrey Hepburn falling in love with Gregory Peck in <i>Roman Holiday</i> to David Lean�s <i>Summertime</i>, featuring Katharine Hepburn�s sexual adventure in Venice, these glossy travelogue romances were shot on location, and established a new model for Hollywood filmmaking.
</p>

<p>As Robert Shandley shows in <i>Runaway Romances</i>, these films
were not only indicative of the ideology of the American-dominated
postwar world order, but they also represented a shift in Hollywood
production values. Eager to capture new audiences during a period of
economic crisis, Hollywood�s European output utilized a variety of devices including location work and the widescreen process to enhance cinematic experience. The films&#151<i>To Catch a
Thief, Three Coins in the Fountain,</i> <i>Funny Face</i> among them&#151enticed viewers to visit faraway places for romantic escapades. Films such as <i>A Foreign Affair</i> and <i>I Was a Male War Bride</i> considered what it means to have American troops living abroad. In the process, these travelogue romances captured American fantasies for a brief, but intense, period that ended as audiences grew tired of Old World splendors, and entered into a new era of sexual awakening.</p></p>

<BR><H2 class="inpageheading">Reviews</h2><p>
<p><I>"Shandley persuasively shows that the �travelogue romance� genre has something to tell us about history, culture, and ideology as well as film aesthetics and economics. He weaves original research into a compelling narrative argument.  This is an excellent book of cultural history and film history."</I><br>&#151<b>Peter Lev</b>, Professor in the Department of Electronic Media and Film at Towson University, and author of <i>The Fifties: Transforming the Screen, 1950-1959</i>

<p><i>"In this pleasant monograph, Shandley examines Hollywood's 'European Travelogue romances, 1947-1964,' which he imagines to constitute a genre.... This is a book for those interested in specialized film and genre study."</i> <br>&#151<b><i>Choice</i></b>

<p><i>"Robert R. Shandley's intriguing new text </i>Runaway Romances<i> offers a fresh, in-depth analysis of a genre....[T]his seminal work [is] a must for film enthusiast[s] historians, and researchers." </i> <br>&#151<b><i>Film and History</i></b>

<p><i>"Shandley makes the case for what he calls runaway or travelog romances as a legitimate film genre.... In this well-researched book, he devotes chapters to the 'occupation romance' and the use of widescreen and also includes an extensive bibliography. A useful analysis."</i><br>&#151<b><i>Library Journal</i></b>

<p><i>"[D]elightful and perceptive.... Shandley's solid grasp of the basics of filmmaking is apparent throughout, and he is a careful, credible, trustworthy reader of film narrative, often getting at meaning by looking at how films create and solve problems.... [T]his [is a] thoughtful and engaging book." </i><br>&#151<b> <i>American Studies</i></b>
