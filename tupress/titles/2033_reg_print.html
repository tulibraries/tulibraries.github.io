<p><i>Temple University: 125 Years of Service to Philadelphia, the Nation, and the World</i>, by noted historian and Temple professor James Hilty, offers the first full history of Temple University. Lovingly written and beautifully designed, it presents a rich chronicle from founder Russell Conwell’s vision to democratize, diversify, and broaden the reach of higher education to Temple's present day status as the twenty-eighth largest university and the fifth largest provider of professional education in the United States. With its state-of-the-art technological capabilities, improved amenities, and new multimillion dollar facilities, Temple remains at the forefront of America’s modern urban universities.</p>
<p>The book captures Temple’s long record of service to its North Philadelphia neighbors, its global reach to Rome, Tokyo, and beyond, and its development from a rowhouse campus into a lively 11,000- resident urban village at its main campus&#151all the while assuring "Access to Excellence." Along the way, we learn how Temple reacted to and helped shape major developments in the history of American higher education.</p>
<p>Featuring 250 full-color photos, <i>Temple University</i> provides a wonderful keepsake for those who already know the university and will become a valued resource for anyone interested in the urban university.  </p></p>
<BR><H2 class="inpageheading">Reviews</h2><p>
<p><i>"[E]ntertaining and enlightening.... Author Hilty was the right choice to tackle this ambitious endeavor.... Aside from Hilty's colorful portrait of [Temple University founder Russell] Conwell and the Philadelphia of his time -- he was actually a New Englander -- one of the book's great joys (in addition to its many splendid illustrations) are the little facts and tidbits that pepper the text." </i>
