<P><p>Baseball fans love to second-guess managers' strategies and speculate about their styles of managing and Leonard Koppett is no exception.  Koppett brings 52 years as a working baseball writer to his understanding of these men in the dugout. 

<p>His analysis is based on personal interaction with all of the managers active since 1950 and their descriptions and judgments of the generation of men who preceded them.  Every manager inherits his method from some influential manager he played for.  Three seminal figures&#151John McGraw, Connie Mack, and Branch Rickey&#151form the trunk of a genealogical tree whose branches have eventually intertwined, but whose key characteristics remain identifiable nearly a century later in the style of current headliners like Joe Torre, Jim Leyland, Tony LaRussa, Dusty Baker, and Bobby Cox.

<p>This highly acclaimed study, first published in 1993, has been updated to the year 2000 and now includes some recent winning managers and completes the careers of others.</p>

<BR><H2 class="inpageheading">Reviews</h2><p>
<p><i>"Long before the 'scholarly' study of baseball became something of a cottage industry, Leonard Koppett was out there doing it on his own with his keen reporter's eye, tireless research, and logical mind.  Through the years, reading Koppett has been a joy and an education."</i>
<br>&#151<b>Bob Costas</b>

<p><i>"What a pleasure it is to read Leonard Koppett on the history and science&#151no, make that Art, with a capital A&#151of managing a major-league baseball team."</i>  
<br>&#151<b>Robert W. Creamer</b>, author of <i>Babe: The Legend Comes to Life</i>, <i>Stengel</i>, and <i>Baseball in '41</i>

<p><i>"Nobody in sports has ever provided your brain with a better workout than Leonard Koppett.  To borrow from the old E. F. Hutton spot, 'When Leonard Koppett talks, I listen&#151very, very attentively.'"</i>
<br>&#151<b>Al Michaels</b>
