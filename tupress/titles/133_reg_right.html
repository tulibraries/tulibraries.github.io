<P>Although Marxism came late to Latin America, Marxist theories and practices have been of vast importance to Latin American countries, especially during the last decade.  Luis Aguilar has revised and updated his 1968 anthology of articles by Latin Americans by adding eleven new articles, including writings by Fidel Castro on Cuba's Involvement in Angola and articles by and about Salvdore Allende and the failure of the Chilean socialist experiment.  This new section is preceded by six groups of articles covering the time from 1890, when Marxist thought was first developing in Latin America, to the period of the Cuban Revolution and its aftermath and including the criticism and self-criticism of the sixties.  The book is the only collection of primary and interpretive documents on Marxism by Latin Americans.

  <P><I>"The guerrilla conflict has posed no end of problems as to its necessity, methods, and objectives.  In Guatemala, one of the countries where the struggle has been most tenacious and prolonged, the Communist Party has been accused, at one and the same time, of being 'pacifist' and wanting to control the direction of the guerilla movement.  In the [following] article, Jos&#233 Mill&#225, one of the principal guatemalan communist leaders, maintains the classic posture of 'flexible unity' in the face of what he calls 'provocations' of certain groups.  The rupture of the Communist Party of Guatemala with Jon Sosa and the 13th of November Movement, which is merely sketched here, became explicit and public in the Tricontinental congress (Havana, January 1966) when Turcios Lima, then chief of the Fuerzas Armadas Rebeldes (FAR) was extolled as the legitimate representative of the guerrilla struggle, while the 13th of November Movement was stigmatized as Trotskyist."</I>
<P>"In the struggle agains the military dictatorship importance is attached to building a united front of all democratic forces.
<P>"An event of considerable significance was the establishment of the United Resistance Front (FRU) which comprises all the democratic political groupings, including our Party.  The FRU, founded following the military coup of March 30, 1963, is a political alliance for the purpose of overthrowing the reactionary regime and forming a democratic government.
<P>"Another important event was the creation of the Rebel Armed Forces (FAR).  The news of the formation of these forces had repercussions throughout the country.  The FAR is a military-political alliance uniting all political groups and movements which support or help the armed struggle.  Our Party is making an active contribution to its cause.  The armed struggle in Guatemala is waged under a unified leadership.
<P>"True, beginning with last July, provocateurs who wormed their way into the "November 13" organization (one of the bodies belinging to the FAR) have been busy sapping the unity of the armed forces, trying to get their commander, Jon Sosa, to support their sectarian line, which completely ignores the real situation in Guatemala.
