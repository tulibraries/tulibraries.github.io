<P>Philadelphia is a patchwork of the political and economic changes dating back to 1683.  Having been re-created repeatedly, each era of the city's development includes elements of the past.  In this book, the authors describe the city's evolution into a post-industrial metropolis of old communities and newly expended neighborhoods, in which remnants of 19th-century industries can be seen in today's residential areas.
<P>This book explores a wide range of issues impacting upon Philadelphia's post-industrial economy&#151trends in housing and homelessness, the business community, job distribution, a disintegrating political structure, and increased racial, class, and neighborhood conflict.  The authors examine the growth of the service sector, the disparity in the city's urban renewal program that has enriched center city but left most neighborhoods in need, and they evaluate the realistic prospects for regional solutions to some of the problems facing Philadelphia and its suburbs.

<BR>&nbsp;<h2>Reviews</h2>
<P><I>"The multidisciplinary team of locally active urban researchers assembled for this book concisely explores and interrelates issues of uneven intra-urban development, white middle-class suburbanization, residential segregation of races and social classes, disinvestment, minority political power, and the concentration of nonwhites and the poor as they apply in the Delaware Valley metropolitan area.  Four decades ago, Philadelphia was viewed as a model of urban renewal; its subsequent economic decline and the intensifying divisions that bedevil its social fabric dominate this thoughtful analysis.... Bibliographic notes are a thorough and up-to-date guide to the considerable scholarly literature on this metropolis.  Tables, graphs, and more than a dozen excellent maps further enhance the presentation.  Highly recommended."</I>
