<BLOCKQUOTE><p><i>"Wilcox, Cullen, and Feldmeyer have done the field a major service with this powerful and timely review of enduring neighborhood stratification and its consequences for crime. </i>Communities and Crime <i> is theoretically rich and exhaustively comprehensive, which makes for an invaluable contribution to the study of neighborhood processes. </i>Communities and Crime <i> will be widely read and cited across disciplines</i>."<br>&#8212;<b>Eric A. Stewart</b>, Ronald L. Simons Professor of Criminology at Florida State University<br>

<P><p>Social scientists have long argued over the links between crime and place. The authors of <i>Communities and Crime</i> provide an intellectual history that traces how varying images of community have evolved over time and influenced criminological thinking and criminal justice policy.<br/><br/>The authors outline the major ideas that have shaped the development of theory, research, and policy in the area of communities and crime. Each chapter examines the problem of the community through a defining critical or theoretical lens: the community as social disorganization; as a system of associations; as a symptom of larger structural forces; as a result of criminal subcultures; as a broken window; as crime opportunity; and as a site of resilience. <br/><br/>Focusing on these changing images of community, the empirical adequacy of these images, and how they have resulted in concrete programs to reduce crime, <i>Communities and Crime </i>theorizes about and reflects upon why some neighborhoods produce so much crime. The result is a tour of the dominant theories of place in social science today.<br>

<p><i>"</i>Communities and Crime <i> probes one of the most vital and intellectually exciting areas of the discipline. Why do some communities experience higher crime rates than others?  Why are these differences so enduring, despite turnover in residents? Criminologists have argued for much of the last century over questions such as these, producing seminal research and leading theories. Wilcox, Cullen, and Feldmeyer provide an authoritative account of this important body of work that makes for fascinating reading. Their intellectual history melds seamlessly with a synthesis of contemporary research, making this a book for all criminologists and students of crime to read. I look forward to assigning </i>Communities and Crime <i> in class and continuing to learn from its insights.</i>"<br>&#8212;<b>Robert J. Sampson</b>, Harvard University, and author of <i>Great American City: Chicago and the Enduring Neighborhood Effect</i><br>
