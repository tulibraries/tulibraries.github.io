	<BLOCKQUOTE><p><i>"Grounded in historical analyses about the theories and practices of civic participation in democratic societies, </i>Knowledge for Social Change <i> provides wonderful examples of and provocative perspectives on the critical role that higher education institutions&#8212;especially research universities&#8212;play in advancing social change in contemporary society. This book should be required reading for students in every college and university across the land."</i><br/>

	<P><p>Employing history, social theory, and a detailed contemporary case study<i>, Knowledge for Social Change </i>argues for fundamentally reshaping research universities to function as democratic, civic, and community-engaged institutions dedicated to advancing learning and knowledge for social change. The authors focus on significant contributions to learning made by Francis Bacon, Benjamin Franklin, Seth Low, Jane Addams, William Rainey Harper, and John Dewey&#8212;as well as their own work at Penn's Netter Center for Community Partnerships to help create and sustain democratically engaged colleges and universities for the public good.  <br><p><i>Knowledge for Social Change</i> highlights university-assisted community schools to effect a thoroughgoing change of research universities that will contribute to more democratic schools, communities, and societies. The authors also call on democratic-minded academics to create and sustain a global movement dedicated to advancing learning for the "relief of man's estate"&#8212;an iconic phrase by Francis Bacon that emphasized the continuous betterment of the human condition&#8212;and to realize Dewey's vision of an organic "Great Community" composed of participatory, democratic, collaborative, and interdependent societies.<br>

			<p>"Knowledge for Social Change <em> is an important book that should be read by all who are interested in strengthening research universities by calling them back to their civic mission."</em><br>  &#8212;<strong>Ellen Condliffe Lagemann</strong>, Levy Institute Research Professor, Bard College, and Distinguished Fellow, Bard Prison Initiative<br>
</p>
<p><i>"This book is a must-read for those of us responsible for educating students who will become our future world leaders.</i> Knowledge for Social Change <i> proposes that research universities become radically transformed to function as democratic, civic, and community-engaged institutions, and I could not agree with the idea more.</i>"<br/>&#8212;<b>Eduardo J. Padr&#243;n</b>, President, Miami Dade College<br>
	
			<p><i>"Individually and collectively, the [authors] have made important contributions to the literature on higher education prior to this collaboration. And they have done a remarkable job of producing a collective work of clarity and coherence that comes across as a single voice and avoids repetition. It is a book that should be widely read by engaged scholars, practitioners, administrative leaders, and students of engagement."</i><br>
