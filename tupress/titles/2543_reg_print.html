The backgrounds of the four figures reveal a mixing of nationalities, a borrowing of cultures, and a combination of domestic and overseas interests.<br/><br/>Edward Tang shows how the film, art, and literature made by these artists revealed to the American public the linked processes of U.S. actions at home and abroad. Their work played into-but also challenged-the postwar rehabilitated images of Japan and Japanese Americans as it focused on the history of transpacific relations such as Japanese immigration to the United States, the Asia-Pacific War, U.S. and Japanese imperialism, and the wartime confinement of Japanese Americans. <i>From Confinement to Containment </i>shows the relationships between larger global forces as well as how the artists and writers responded to them in both critical and compromised ways <i>.</i><br/><br/>In the series <i>Asian American History and Culture, </i>edited by Cathy Schlund-Vials, Rick Bonus, and Shelley Sang-Hee Lee.

Like the field from which it emerged, the series remains rooted in the social sciences and humanities, encompassing multiple regions, formations, communities, and identities. Extending the vision of founding editor Sucheng Chan and emeriti editor Michael Omi, David Palumbo-Liu, K. Scott Wong and Linda Trinh VÃµ, series editors Cathy Schlund-Vials, Rick Bonus, and Shelley Sang-Hee Lee continue to develop a foundational collection that embodies a range of theoretical and methodological approaches to Asian American studies.</p></P></P></P><P>&nbsp;</P><font face="Arial" size="1"><a href="copyright.html" OnMouseOver="window.status='Web Copyright Policy';return true;" OnMouseOut="window.status=''" TITLE="Web Copyright Policy">&copy;</a> 2019 <a href="http://www.temple.edu" target="new" OnMouseOver="window.status='Link to Temple University home page';return true;" OnMouseOut="window.status=''" TITLE="Link to Temple University home page">Temple University</a>.
