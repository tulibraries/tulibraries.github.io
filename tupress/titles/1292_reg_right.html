<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>"Criticizing managers has always been a popular pastime, especially for fans. In fact, baseball's dugout directors believe that no other profession is second-guessed to the extent theirs is. More than a century's worth of evidence supports their position.  However, not any of them&#151from McGraw to Bucky Harris to the Deacon McKechnie to feisty Billy Martin and on to today's Dusty Baker, Tom Kelly, and Bobby Cox (or even to Tom Hanks in </i>A League of Their Own<i>)&#151would forego the opportunity to manage a baseball team."</I>
<br>&#151From the Introduction<I></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI><p>Why is baseball the only team sport whose managers wear a uniform?</LI>
<LI><p>Which two managers have led three different teams to the World Series?</LI>
<LI><p>Who was the last player-manager?</LI>
<LI><p>Which managers' uniform numbers have been retired?</LI>
<LI><p>What happened when Ted Turner took over as manager after Atlanta had posted 16 consecutive losses?</LI>
</UL>
<p>These and many more questions are answered in Bob Bloss's <i>Baseball Managers</i>. The perfect book to have for settling a baseball argument, it contains records of each of the more than 400 twentieth-century managers. It traces managing evolution from the original Cincinnati Red Stockings to the Arizona Diamondbacks and from the early days of player-managers and their fourteen-man squads to today's relentless fan and media second-guessing and the emergence of free agency&#151which now often forces managers to enter battle with teams vastly restructured from the previous season.  

<p>With chapters on controversial managerial decisions Hall-of-Fame manager profiles and oddball managerial situations, humorous and sometimes poignant anecdotes, and many useful tables listing managers alphabetically, by teams, and by winning percentages, <i>Baseball Managers</i> is a fascinating compilation of statistics, trivia, and memories.
