</P></td></tr></table><BR><P><p><I>Fast Wheels, Slow Traffic</I> shows how the characteristics of modes of transportation can be combined to produce affordable, environmentally sound solutions to urban transport problems&#151solutions tailored to meet the demands of cities with radically different economies and transportation needs.  With provocative and often entertaining examples, Charles Wright elucidates the problems endemic to urban transportation systems and the faculty analysis endemic to urban planning.

<p>In examining the traits of various transport modes, Wright builds a case that favors busses over cars or railway systems.  All manner of conveyances studied, including walking and cycling, and practical examples are drawn from both the United States and abroad.  One such example is Brasília, the modernistic Brazilian capital, designed in the 1950s, which is a paradox of modern transportation.  Here, city planners, relying on the automobile, separated residential and business districts.  As a result, Brasília, with lower population density than other Brazilian cities, has far greater congestion and has become notoriously dangerous city for pedestrians trying to cross the street.

<p>The author demonstrates how promoters of expensive transport systems have "lied with statistics" to make their cases.  Whether it's a matter of crossing the street in Brasília or riding a bike in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Wright sees transport planning as a cooperative process&#151the best solutions are simple, low-cost, environmentally sound, and sustainable.</p>
