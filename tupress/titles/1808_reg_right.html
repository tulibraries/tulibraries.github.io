<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>"This wonderful volume not only points out the importance to each child of a strong language base, but of the emotional background which it represents.... [It] emphasizes the importance of the quality of a child's life outside the home [and] demands that we provide them with the ratio of 3:1 adults in infancy, adults who are paid, trained, and respected. We are investing in our children's future!"</i>
<br>&#151<b>T. Berry Brazelton</b>, M.D., from the Foreword<i></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Drawing on the latest research on development among toddlers and preschoolers, <i>At a Loss for Words</i> lays out the importance of getting parents, policy makers, and child care providers to recognize the role of early literacy skills in reducing the achievement gap that begins before three years of age. Readers are guided through home and classroom settings that promote language, contrasting them with the "merely mediocre" child care settings in which more and more young children spend increasing amounts of time. Too many of our young children are not receiving the level of input and practice that will enable them to acquire language skills&#151the key to success in school and life. Bardige explains how to build better community support systems for children, and better public education, in order to ensure that toddlers learn the power of language from their families and teachers.

<P><p><i>"This book is essential reading for scholars, parents, and child caregivers. The author splendidly integrates decades of research to make the convincing case that our society's nurturance of the young is inadequate. To improve the rearing of our children, the first step is arming ourselves with both the knowledge and recommendations presented in this book."</i>
