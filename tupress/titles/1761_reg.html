</P><p><i>P Is for Philadelphia</i> is a unique, alphabetic tour of the city and the region, illustrated by the area's public school children, who participated in a city-wide drawing contest.

<p>From A is for Athlete to Z is for Zoo, all of the city's rich history is explored. <i>P Is for Philadelphia</i> includes entries on William Penn's arrival and historic treaty with the Delaware Indians, the city's heritage as the cradle of American liberty, as well as its food, sports teams, neighborhoods, and festivals.

<p>Published to coincide with Read Across America Day 2005, this book will have the kind of  impact on Philadelphia and the region that few children's books ever have. It belongs on the bedside tables of every child in the Delaware Valley and the bookshelves of every visitor.

<BR>&nbsp;<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p><i>"It's a fun read, and the illustrations grab your attention. The students put a lot of effort into these drawings, from the realistic depiction of the stones in Elfreth's Alley to the impressionistic view of the river as the Delaware Indians gathered there.... This is collaboration at its best."</i>
<br>&#151<b><i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i></b>

<p><i>"In addition to the text being exclusively about our home, and having lots of pretty pictures, the book is special because "P is for Philadelphia" is illustrated by the children of Philadelphia."</i>
<br>&#151<b><i>Philadelphia Daily News</i></b>

<p><I>"A creative and informative blend of text and art, this alphabet book celebrates much of what the city has to offer.... The book is a grand tour of the city, its history, and its creative spirit.... It could also serve as an inspiration for students to create similar books for any geographical area."</I>
