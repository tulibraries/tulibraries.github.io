<p>Recently, after eight years in office, the socialist mayor of Burlington, Vermont, Bernard Sanders, stepped down. This is a case study of the achievements and failures of Sanders� radical administration&#151amidst a conservative trend nationally, an unsympathetic state government, and a hostile city council. W. J. Conroy analyzes the reforms that Burlington�s radicals attempted. He identifies four questions regarding Burlington�s experience that resonated beyond the city�s  boundaries and are addressed in this book: How much autonomy did local government possess?  Were the needs and constraints of the business community the primary forces that circumscribed local autonomy? Did the non-economic demands of the new social movements (Burlington�s ecologists, peace activists, and gays and lesbians) face different constraints than did the economic reforms and thus have a greater chance for enactment? What lessons can be drawn from the case of Burlington that would aid the American left in its struggle to capture both government and civil society?

<p>Through several case studies, Conroy documents the frustration that Sanders and the  progressive Coalition endured over issues such as waterfront development, the building of the four-lane Southern Connector, and alternate sources of taxation. He analyzes the economic development, tax, foreign affairs, and gender policy initiatives of Burlington�s left from a post-Marxist perspective and he offers a controversial localist strategy to revitalize the American left.
