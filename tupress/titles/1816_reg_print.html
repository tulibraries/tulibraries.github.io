</P></td></tr></table><BR><P><p><i>Masters of the Sabar</i> is the first book to examine the music and culture of Wolof griot percussionists, masters of the vibrant sabar drumming tradition. Based on extensive field research in Senegal, this book is a biographical study of several generations of percussionists in a Wolof griot (<i>g�w�l</i>) family, exploring and documenting their learning processes, repertories, and performance contexts&#151;from life-cycle ceremonies to sporting events and political meetings. Patricia Tang examines the rich history and changing repertories of sabar drumming, including dance rhythms and <i>b�kks</i>, musical phrases derived from spoken words. She notes the recent shift towards creating new <i>b�kks</i> which are rhythmically more complex and highlight the virtuosity and musical skill of the percussionist. She also considers the burgeoning popular music genre called <i>mbalax</i>.

<p>The compact disc that accompanies the book includes examples of the standard sabar repertory, as well as <i>b�kks</i> composed and performed by Lamine Tour� and his family drum troupe.</p>
<BR><H2 class="inpageheading">Reviews</h2><p>
<p><i>�Tang adds a unique perspective by highlighting the role of the sabar drum among Wolof griots�.She provides a thorough analysis of the standard rhythms�The accompanying CD is a wonderful resource.�</i>
<br>&#151;<b><i>Choice</i></b>

<p><i>�This excellent publication�[is] a well-written account [of] the music and culture of Wolof Griot percussionists�an important addition to the literature.�
</i><br>&#151;<b><i>Multicultural Review</i></b>

<p><i>�Tang�s ethnography is lucid and engaging� [Her] study is particularly significant for examining the performance of sabar beyond its indigenous social and aesthetic frames�. </i>Masters of the Sabar<i> represents a significant contribution in this direction.�</i>
<br>&#151;<b><i>African Studies Review</i></b>

<p><i>"[A]n important contribution to scholarship of West African music cultures and the hereditary caste system into which griots are born. Tang�s integration of oral history sources with other contemporary and historic sources, as well as her care in transcription and translation, sets a high standard for the presentation of research findings. Her autoethnographic introduction will surely assume an important place in research methodology courses."</i>
