</P><BLOCKQUOTE><I>"</I>Against Instinct<I> is well organized, nicely argued, and extraordinarily well-written.  This book will be a challenge to the dominant view.  Among its virtues is the author's rich use of philosophical and other sources; his use of image is wonderful throughout.  Its readership should include philosophers of psychology, mind, action, biology, and science as well as those interested in the prospects of AI work.  Philosophers will learn some psychology; psychologists might learn some philosophy."</I>
<br>&#151<b>Don Gustafson</b>, University of Cincinnati<I></I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Are we genetically programmed to behave as we do and to learn what we do? is human control over human destiny biologically and, ultimately, physically predetermined? Is our ability to vary ad lib the amount and direction of our personal efforts an idle illusion? Against Instinct challenges recent philosophy’s all too common "Yes, but" answers to these questions. In this skeptical critique of the rampant nativism of the behavioral and cognitive sciences, Dennis M. Senchuk confronts the full range of experimental and bio-theoretical supports for the claim of instinct. Instead of arguing in favor of nurture over nature, he reorients this perennial controversy along a different axis. In the process, Senchuk propounds and defends a novel, radically non-nativistic philosophy of action and of mind.
