<P><p>Providing an original look at twentieth-century service occupations, Nona Y. Glazer offers an innovative interpretation of how managers reduce labor costs by shifting labor for paid women workers to women as family members.  She critically examines the past and present practices of retailing and health service occupations as a way to better understand the deskilling, speed-ups, and job consolidation of nurses, salesclerks, and cashiers.

<p>Glazer calls the shifting of tasks from paid to unpaid labor the "work transfer," one of the many mechanisms that managers used to change the labor process in service jobs.  She maintains that these shifts in labor costs increase profit margins in a capitalistic economy that demands such increases.  Drawing on social history, economics, interviews with health service workers, union newsletter accounts, and advertisements in mass market magazines and retail trade journals, this book affords new insights into how the hidden work of women is structured by changes in paid labor.</p>

<p><I>"Glazer lays out theoretical perspectives that make her empirical observations more widely useful and significant.  She offers a genuinely original way of looking at twentieth-century service occupations&#151a highly significant and largely untapped subject."</I>
