It seeks to buttress Botwinick's conception of agnosticism as a self-critical skepticism, now with application to democratic theory on a global scale.  The book is timely, competently argued, and lucidly written."</I>

<P><p>In <I>Postmodernism and Democratic Theory</I>, Aryeh Botwinick is concerned with defining postmodernism and exploring its political-economic dimensions.  Previous attempts at definition have foundered because the theory has a built-in incoherence: in their rejection of reasoned argument, postmodernists must rely on reasoned argument to make their case.  This issue of "self-referentialism" is pivotal, for example, in Habermas's criticism of the postmodernists.  But Botwinick shows that postmodernism can be coherently conceived as a "generalized agnosticism," which remains open to all possibilities&#151including the possibility of its own falsity.  In developing this view of postmodernism, he applies it to the work of a whole range of both classic and contemporary political and economic thinkers&#151from Plato, Hobbes, Rousseau, Freud, and Wittgenstein to Habermas, Lyotard, and Strauss&#151and attempts to plot the transition between modernist and postmodernist democratic society.</p>

<p><i>"He calls for a revolution in our notion of the kind of thinking appropriate to democratic politics&#151for nothing less than a different, if more difficult and overtly political, kind of coherence."</i>
