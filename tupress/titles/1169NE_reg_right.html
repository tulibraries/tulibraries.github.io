<h3 class="author">edited by Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic</h3>
<P>Critical Race Theory has become a dynamic, eclectic, and growing movement in the study of law. With this third edition of <I>Critical Race Theory</I>, editors Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic have created a reader for the twenty-first century—one that shakes up the legal academy, questions comfortable liberal premises, and leads the search for new ways of thinking about our nation's most intractable, and insoluble, problem—race. 

<P>The contributions, from a stellar roster of established and emerging scholars, address new topics, such as intersectionality and black men on the "down low." Essays also confront much-discussed issues of discrimination, workplace dynamics, affirmative action, and sexual politics. Also new to this volume are updated section introductions, author notes, questions for discussion, and reading lists for each unit. The volume also covers the spread of the movement to other disciplines such as education.

<P>Offering a comprehensive and stimulating snapshot of current race jurisprudence and thought, this new edition of <I>Critical Race Theory</I> is essential for those interested in law, the multiculturalism movement, political science, education, and critical thought.
