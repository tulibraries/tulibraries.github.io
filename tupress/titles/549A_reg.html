</P><P>In this new edition of the classic book on the moral conduct of war, Sidney Axinn provides a full-length treatment of the military conventions from a philosophical point of view. Axinn considers these basic ethical questions within the context of the laws of warfare: Should a good soldier ever disobey a direct military order? Are there restrictions on how we fight a war? What is meant by “military honor,” and does it really affect the contemporary soldier? Is human dignity possible under battlefield conditions?</P>

<P>Axinn answers “yes” to these questions. His objective in <i>A Moral Military</i> is to establish a basic framework for moral military action and to assist in analyzing military professional ethics. He argues for the seriousness of the concept of military honor but limits honorable military activity by a strict interpretation of the notion of war crime.</P>

<P>With revisions and expansions throughout, including a new chapter on torture, <i>A Moral Military</i> is an essential guide on the nature of war during a time when the limits of acceptable behavior are being stretched in new directions.</P>
