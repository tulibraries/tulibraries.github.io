<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>"Producers and consumers of theory of justice literature should read this book.  It is a major work...both libertarianism and welfare state liberalism are articulated and put to the test by Narveson.  The book is well written, and quite funny, and is therefore suitable for classroom use."</I>
<br>&#151;<b><I>The Journal of Politics</I></b><I></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>In his analysis of the philosophy of libertarianism, Jan Narveson distinguishes it from conservatism, with which it is often confounded, and asks if the libertarian position is really as extreme as is generally thought. A controversial theory that equates moral legitimacy with maximum individual freedom, libertarianism appears to have radical social and political implications. In his discussion of the essentials of libertarian theory, Narveson weighs major arguments that have been advanced for and against it and considers the difficulties encountered in applying the principle to real-life situations and in the formulation of public policy.

<p>Libertarianism, as understood in current moral and political philosophy, is the doctrine that the only relevant consideration in political matters is individual liberty&#151insofar as it does not infringe on another person’s individual liberty. Asserting that this is the pure form of liberalism, the author provides an exposition and defense of the coherence of libertarian theory and examines the question of its foundations. After addressing the questions "Is libertarianism possible?" and "Is libertarianism rational?" in the first two parts of the book, the author considers how the theory could be applied to matters of policy. Treating such diverse issues as abortion, the rights of children, public education, freedom of speech, the legalization of drugs, public property and zoning laws, discrimination in hiring, and questions of defense and international relations, he shows both the merits and the limitations of the position. Throughout, Narveson employs the contractarian approach.

<P><p><I>"An original and well-rounded contribution to two growing traditions: libertarianism and contractarianism.  As such, it should be of considerable general interest among political philosophers.  Its originality is equally evident in its style of exposition, its argumentative strategy, and the conclusions reached, combining to an uncommon degree an acute understanding of high-level moral theory with a serious concern for how this bears on concrete social policy.  In short, it is a thoroughly challenging and quite engaging book."</I>
<br>&#151<b><I>Canadian Journal of Philosophy</I></b>

<p><I>"This book is indeed a major contribution to the philosophical controversy over libertarianism.  It ranks in importance with Nozick's [</I>Anarchy, State, and Utopia<I>], [and] John Rawlins's </I>A Theory of Justice<I>."</I>
<br>&#151<b><I>Liberty</I></b>

<p><I>"Narveson has written an original and important book that opponents of libertarianism will have to study and that libertarians will enjoy studying.  No one who reads it can fail to be provoked and enlightened."</I>

p><I>"[In] Narveson's new, bold, and highly readable book...he aims, quite simply, to provide the secure foundations that libertarianism apparently lacks."</I>

<p><I>"This is a scholarly, well-thought-out book by someone who knows the current scholarly literature as well as knowing his way around thoroughly in ethics and social philosophy."</I>
<br>&#151<b>John Hospers</b>, University of Southern California 

<p><I>"Narveson provides an original contribution to philosophy. He raises three principal questions about libertarianism. First, is it possible? Second, what are the policy implications of libertarianism? And third, is libertarianism rational? ... A relevant and stimulating discussion."</I>
