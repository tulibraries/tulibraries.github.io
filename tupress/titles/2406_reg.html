That experience, along with lessons learned as the only Latino law student at Temple University, would drive him throughout his life as a lawyer and activist, fighting for the expansion of rights for all Americans. <br/><br/> <i>"</i>No soy de aqu&#237; ni de all&aacute; <i>"</i> is a mantra for Puerto Ricans who feel like foreigners wherever they are and who seek a place for themselves. In his inspiring autobiography, <i>Not from Here, Not from There</i>, D&#237;az tells the story of his struggles and triumphs as his perspective widened from the New York streets and law school classrooms to the halls of power in Philadelphia and Washington, DC. Whether as a leader in economic development, a pioneer in court reform, or a champion of fair housing, D&#237;az has never stopped advocating for others. D&#237;az was happy to be the first Latino to "do something," but he never wanted to be the last. This story of an outsider who worked his way to the inside offers powerful lessons on finding a place in the world by creating spaces where everyone is welcome.<br><P CLASS="top"><A HREF="#top">BACK TO TOP</A></P>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;<P></P><BR>&nbsp;<H2  class="inpageheading"><A NAME="author bio"></a>About the Author(s)</H2><p><b>Nelson A. D&#237;az</b>, who graduated from St. John's University in 1969 and from Temple University Law School in 1972, was the first Puerto Rican lawyer to pass the Pennsylvania Bar Examination and the first Latino judge, administrative judge, and partner in a top-100 law firm in the state. Appointed by President Jimmy Carter to a White House Fellowship and by President Bill Clinton as General Counsel to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, he has had a legendary career serving as a public defender, as Philadelphia City Solicitor, and as a member of several corporate boards, including Exelon Corporation, a Fortune 100 company. His fight for civil and human rights and his promotion of neighborhood economic development and housing reform have blazed a trail for other Latinos. He lives in Philadelphia with his wife Sara Manzano.<br><P CLASS="top"><A HREF="#top">BACK TO TOP</A></P><p><h2 class="inpageheading"><a name="subjects"></a>Subject Categories</h2> <p><a href="http://www.temple.edu/tempress/biography.html" target="_top">Biography/Memoir/Autobiography</a> <br><a href="http://www.temple.edu/tempress/latino.html" target="_top">Latino/a Studies</a> <br><a href="http://www.temple.edu/tempress/philly.html" target="_top">Philadelphia Region</a> <br><a href="" target="_top"></a> <br><a href="" target="_top"></a> </p></p><P></P><p align="center"><a href="https://cdcshoppingcart.uchicago.edu/Cart/ChicagoBook.aspx?ISBN=&&PRESS=temple" target="_top">Buy this book!</a> | <a href="https://cdcshoppingcart.uchicago.edu/Cart/Cart.aspx?PRESS=temple" target="_top">View Cart</a> | <a href="https://cdcshoppingcart.uchicago.edu/Cart/Cart.aspx?PRESS=temple" target="_top">Check Out</a></p><p><font face="Arial" size="1"><a href="copyright.html" onMouseOver="window.status='Web Copyright Policy';return true;" onMouseOut="window.status=''" title="Web Copyright Policy">&copy;</a> 2018 <a href="http://www.temple.edu" target="new" onMouseOver="window.status='Link to Temple University home page';return true;" onMouseOut="window.status=''" title="Link to Temple University home page">Temple University</a>.
