</P></td></tr></table><BR><P><p>In this volume, a major historian of American culture assembles for the first time a number of his classic essays which have greatly influenced the cultural interpretation of American society. Many of these essays have helped shape significant areas in recent historiography, particularly the history of venereal disease, morals, behaviorism, psychoanalysis, and popular psychology. A new essay on the historiography of sex is included. Original introductory material, editorial transitions, and a conclusion join these chapters in intellectual and social history in making a strong case for a cultural approach to America’s past.</p>

</p><p>The focus of <i>American Civilization</i>, edited by Allen F. Davis, is American cultural history.  In keeping with the interdisciplinary work in this field, which characteristically brings together art history, literary history and theory, and material culture, the titles in this series cover diverse aspects of American experience&#151from attitudes toward death to twentieth-century design innovations to images of country life in art and letters to trade unions' reliance on religious discourse.  The series has been a pioneer in presenting work that uses photographs as historical documents and from its inception has been firmly committed to women's studies.  As the first university press series in the field,  <i>American Civilization</i> provided the inspiration and the standard for much of the interdisciplinary work developing in the contemporary academy.</p>
