<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>"Yandell has put us all in his debt for the care with which he has examined the writings of one of the most influential critics of religion."</I>
<br>&#151<b><I>Journal of Theological Studies</I></b><I></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>The eighteenth-century Scottish empiricist David Hume has been regarded as a notorious enemy of religion. Still, his discussion of religion is systematic, sophisticated, and sustained. Focusing mainly on two of Hume�s works, the relatively neglected <I>Natural History of Religion</I> and the more widely read <I>Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion</I>, Keith Yandell analyzes Hume�s treatment of a subject that he described as "a riddle, an enigma, an inexplicable mystery." In so doing, he explores the relationships between Hume�s philosophy of religion and his general philosophy. 

<p>Hume�s "evidentialism," applied to religion, can be summed up by saying that it is unreasonable to accept a religious belief unless one has evidence for it. Since it is also Hume�s view that there is no evidence for any religious belief, he concludes that no one is ever reasonable in accepting a religious belief. Yandell examines the explanations that Hume gave for such acceptance in <I>Natural History of Religion</I>. Addressing the <I>Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion</I>, he compares Hume�s views to those of such authors as Herbert of Cherbury and Bishop Joseph Butler, traces changes in Hume�s theory of meaning, and discusses the ontological and cosmological arguments and Hume�s treatment of the problem of evil. Yandell then considers other lesser known writings by Hume that are relevant to his philosophy of religion.

<P><p><I>"[Yandell] offers an interpretation of Hume's philosophy of religion and examines its foundations critically.  The sweep of coverage and the author's control of his material are impressive.  This is a readable and informative study which no one interested in Hume's views on religion can afford to neglect."</I>
<br>&#151<b>James King</b>, Northern Illinois University

<p><I>"[Yandell] has unearthed the underlying philosophical significance of [the </I>Natural History<I>].  That by itself is an important achievement and a valuable scholarly contribution.  Yandell's discussion of the issues in Hume's better known writing is intrinsically important as well as constitution a significant deepening of our approach to issues in Hume's philosophy of religion.  It is a tribute to Yandell's stature as a philosopher that he is able to return to ground which has been so frequently ploughed and still give us new insights and a more perceptive understanding of Hume's method and his results.... It is an original and illuminating reading of a number of major issues in Hume's philosophy."</I>
