</P><BLOCKQUOTE><I>"Any caregiver who makes the effort to read and understand this book will undoubtedly become more knowledgeable about discipline and more effective in relating to children."</I> <br>&#151<b>From the Foreword by Arnold J. Sameroff</b>, Professor Emeritus of Psychology and Human Development, University of Michigan and Former President, The Society for Research in Child Development</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><i>Elements of Discipline</i> is a timely and helpful book for teachers, parents, and day-care professionals that provides a simple set of rules for managing&#8212;successfully and humanely&#8212;a wide range of discipline situations and challenges. A well-respected child development specialist, Stephen Greenspan outlines his "ABC Theory of Discipline." He combines an Affective approach, a Behavioral approach, and a Cognitive approach that, when used in a coordinated fashion, will contribute to greater child compliance and family/classroom harmony. 

<P>Greenspan suggests that, using his matrix, caregivers can provide the warmth, tolerance, and influence that will help children become competent in three socio-emotional domains&#8212;happiness, boldness, and niceness. He recommends caregivers pick and choose from the discipline literature in a manner that best suits their individual style and values. 

<P><i>Elements of Discipline</i> is a lively guide to effective classroom or family management.

<BR>&nbsp;<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p><I>"</I>Elements of Discipline<I> is the most cohesive, concrete, and practical treatment of the topic of discipline I have read to date. Stephen Greenspan's latest work is a must read for teachers and parents alike."</I> <br>&#151<b>Robert J. Marzano</b>, author of <I>The Art and Science of Teaching and Classroom Management That Works</I>

<p><I>"</I>Elements of Discipline<I> provides a novel synthesis and integration that makes a new, and I believe very valuable, contribution to the field. The book is one that I would recommend to students and colleagues, both for their own personal benefit and to use in their teaching and professional work. Greenspan offers a helpful perspective to disciplining children."</I> <br>&#151<b>Robert Laird</b>, Professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of New Orleans

<p><i>"Greenspan offers a guided discussion on an affective-aware approach to disciplinary practices for both school and home. Throughout the book, Greenspan diligently explains key principles critical to understanding the rationale for incorporating a positivistic approach to discipline and the inherent benefits to children, adolescents, and adults. A thorough discussion is meticulously crafted to offer an explanation of concepts, application, and theoretical connections to existing emotional/behavioral perspectives.... A well-rounded index of theories, terminology, and common behavioral practices to assist readers in developing a more comprehensive understanding to successful discipline completes the book. Summing Up: Recommended."</i> <br>&#151<b>Choice</b>
