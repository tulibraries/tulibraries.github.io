<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>"This volume is a must-have book for anyone who cares about preventing crime and avoiding harmful programs. The book offers McCord's classic evidence that good intentions can produce disastrous results and that crime prevention should be evaluated no less rigorously than a new and powerful drug."</i>
<br>&#151;<b>Lawrence Sherman</b>, Director, Jerry Lee Center for Criminology, University of Pennsylvania<i></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Joan McCord (1930-2004) was one of the most famous, most-respected, and best-loved criminologists of her generation. A brilliant pioneer, Dr. McCord was best known for her work on the Cambridge-Somerville Youth Study, the first large-scale, longitudinal experimental study in the field of criminology. The study was among the first to demonstrate unintended harmful effects of a well-meaning prevention program. Dr. McCord's most important essays from this groundbreaking research project are among those included in this volume.

<p>McCord also co-wrote, edited, or co-edited twelve volumes and authored or co-authored 127 journal articles and book chapters. She wrote across a broad array of subjects, including delinquency, alcoholism, violence, crime prevention, and criminal theory. This book brings her most important and lasting work together in one place for the first time.

<P><p><i>�[McCord] clearly was a researcher of unbounded energy whose life�s work has added greatly to the corpus of criminological knowledge. This book is an excellent collection of that work. The methodology of her research in the developmental study of crime is both classically rigorous and strikingly inventive.� </i>
<br>&#151;<b><i>The Law and Politics Book Review</i></b>

<p><i>�The essays are mostly based on topics close to Joan�s heart: the effects of intervention; the effect of child rearing; punishment and discipline; crime in the family; alcoholism and drunk driving. The book closes with a truly inspiring autobiography and a list of all of her publications.�</i>
