<p>The benchmark volume for any fan wanting to know all the facts about baseball's oldest continuous one-city, one-name team is back in a new edition. To help commemorate the Phillies move to a new ballpark in 2004, authors Rich Westcott and Frank Bilovsky have updated and expanded this indispensable work for the first time since 1993. The authors have revised existing player biographies and stats, and added profiles of new Phillies. Seventy-five new photos and a 16-page color insert bring the total number of illustrations to an amazing 600-plus. And longtime Phils' broadcaster Harry Kalas has contributed a new Foreword for the occasion.

<p><i>The Phillies Encyclopedia</i>,Third Edition, will recall all the highs and the lows of one of America's most storied baseball teams to oldtimers and a new generation of fans alike. From Baker Bowl days to Citizens Bank Park, from Chuck Klein to Jim Thome, it's over a century of  baseball in a single book.

<p>New features include:
<ul><li><p>Over seventy new photographs
<li><p>Updated biographies of every Phillies Hall-of-Famer
<li><p>Updated stats on every player through the end of the 2003 season
<li><p>11 new seasons added
<li><p>Almost every chapter updated with new information on team history
<li><p>New player profiles</ul>

<BR>&nbsp;<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p>Praise for previous editions of <i>The Phillies Encyclopedia</i>:

<p><i>"All baseball fans, especially Phillies fans, should read this </i>Phillies Encyclopedia<i>. It is, without a doubt, the most comprehensive and best-researched history of Phillies baseball ever written. Frank Bilovsky and Rich Westcott are to be commended for writing what was obviously a labor of love. I have been associated with the Phillies organization as a player and broadcaster for 45 years. I loved the book. And I know you will love it also."</i>
<br>&#151<b>the late Richie Ashburn</b>

<p><i>"The authors have every right to use the word 'encyclopedia'...for the breadth of information contained herein is tremendous. The book doesn't provide stats on hot dog and souvenir sales at Veterans Stadium but that's about all that's left out....A fantastic feast for Philly fans!"</i>
<br>&#151<b><i>Spitball Magazine</i></b>

<p><i>"</i>The New Phillies Encyclopedia<i> is the finest and most complete book about any team in sports. The pictures are excellent. This book is a must for any real baseball fan."</i>
<br>&#151<b>Allen Lewis</b>, former <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i> sportswriter and member of the writer's wing of the Baseball Hall of Fame

<p>New Reviews:

<br>&#151<b><i>The Philadelphia City Paper</i></b>

<p><i>"... filled with fascinating anecdotes."</i>
<br>&#151<b><i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i></b>

<p><i>"[I]nvaluable...the book has it all...a delightful companion for anyone with even a passing interest in baseball and the Phillies."</i>
<br>&#151<b><i>The Chestnut Hill Local</i></b>

<p><i>"For a diehard Phillies fan, </i>The Phillies Encyclopedia<i> is a treasure trove of information and a welcome addition to a baseball library."</i>
<br>&#151<b><i>Golden Times</i></b>

<p><i>"[T]his work offers much more fascinating, in-depth, team-related information. For the third time, </i>The Phillies Encyclopedia<i> is affectionately well done and should be an essential purchase in the Philadelphia region."</i>
