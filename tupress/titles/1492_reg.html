<BLOCKQUOTE><I>"The Philadelphia Orchestra continues to be a gleaming jewel in the musical crown of America."</I>
<BR>&#151<B>Isaac Stern</B><I></I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Like the city in which it was born 100 years ago, the Philadelphia Orchestra is known for its classy elegance&#151a sophisticated polish that is impressive without being brash or showy.  But in addition to the lush string sound and piquant winds and brass for which the Orchestra has become famous, the "Fabulous Philadelphians" were also pioneers in American musical life in this century.

<p>Lavishly illustrated with more than 200 photos and engagingly written by twelve prominent writers, <i>The Philadelphia Orchestra: A Century of Music</i> offers the first full history of this great orchestra's tradition and legacy.
<UL>
<LI><p>Premieres of essential masterworks by Sibelius, Mahler, Stravinsky, Rachmaninoff, Schoenberg.
<LI><p>The first orchestra to make electrical recordings, in 1925, and the first to appear on a full-length national radio broadcast.
<LI><p>The first American orchestra to visit China
<LI><p>The orchestra of Disney's <I>Fantasia</I>.</ul>

<P>With wit and scholarship, twelve writers celebrate the 100th anniversary of this world-renowned orchestra by detailing the rich musical history of Philadelphia, as well as the traditions of the Orchestra's music directors, Fritz Scheel, Carl Pohlig, Leopold Stokowski, Eugene Ormandy, Riccardo Muti, and Wolfgang Sawallisch.  They take us to rehearsals and concerts, recording studios and tours, boardrooms and inner-city schools.

<P><I>The Philadelphia Orchestra: A Century of Music</I> also introducts us to the musicians and the Orchestra supporters who have built the ensemble's international stature.  It examines the Orchestra's innovative educational programs, fundraisers, and membership drives.

<P>This elegant keepsake book also features appendices listing the Orchestra's musicians through its entire history, world and U.S. premieres, and a complete discography and filmography.  It is an essential collector's item for music-lovers everywhere, and an electrifying "read" for anyone interested in music in America during the 20th century.
<BR>&nbsp;<h2>Reviews</h2>
<P><I>"The Philadelphia Orchestra's list of conductors and soloists for the last century reads like a book on the history of music...there has not been a great name in music over the last hundred years who has not appeared with the Philadelphia Orchestra."</I>
