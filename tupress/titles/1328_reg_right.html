<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>"King's critical method here is exemplary: the focus stays on the play-text but various revealing contexts are brought to bear, including, in almost every case, production history.  Shawn's plays challenge or test the liberal values of the audience and of the institution of theatre, pushing to its limit the conflict between freedom and authority.  King's analysis of this conflict is lucid and persuasive, brilliantly illuminating what are surely among the darkest texts in modern drama.  W.D. King is a gifted critic and a superb writer, and </I>Writing Wrongs<I> is a work of exceptional critical intelligence and originality."</I>

<p>Wallace Shawn usually appears in our mind's eye as the consummate eccentric actor: the shy literature teacher in <i>Clueless, </i>the diabolically rational villain in <i>The Princess Bride, </i>or as the eponymous protagonist of <i>Vanya on 42nd Street. </i>Few of us realize, however, that Shawn is also one of today's most provocative and political playwrights.

<p><i>Writing Wrongs: The Work of Wallace Shawn </i>is a close and personal look into the life and literary work of the man whom Joseph Papp called "a dangerous writer." As the son of the late William Shawn, renowned editor of <i>The New Yorker, </i>Wallace Shawn was born into privilege and trained to thoroughly liberal values, but his plays relentlessly question the liberal faith in individualism and common decency. In an uncompromising way that is all his own, Shawn registers the shock of the new.

<p>In works such as <i>Aunt Dan and Lemon, My Dinner with Andr&eacute;, </i>and <i>The Designated Mourner, </i>he wrenches out of place all of the usual, comfortable mechanisms by which we operate as audiences. Perhaps our discomfort and struggle to understand a play might provoke some change in the way we see ourselves and behave in relation to others&#151but Shawn offers little in the way of solace.

<p>W.D. King's incisive critiques of the plays and inquiry into the life and times of their author develop a portrait of Shawn as a major figure in contemporary theater.

<h2 class="inpageheading"><A NAME="reviews"></a>Reviews</h2>
<P><p><I>"</I>Writing Wrongs<I> is an eloquent book, giving an important and neglected playwright his due.  Wallace Shawn is almost alone among contemporary American playwrights: His work is morally engaged without being sanctimonious, political without being didactic, graphic without being vulgar.  He confronts us with our hypocrisies, glib opinions, and blind habits, then encourages us to face unanswerable questions&#151about ethics, religion, sex, and privilege.  Many of Shawn's characters are marvelously fluent, but the most theatrical moments of his plays are silent and halting&#151when a besieged character cannot rely on his or her usual way of thinking and must devise a new, more personal response to the world.

"W.D. King is sensitive to all of these aspects of Shawn's theatre.  In what is the only book-length study of Shaw, King places him in the context of his culture and provides lucid interpretations of the major plays and films.  King is a confident writer, beckoning the reader to follow along as he makes provocative connections between, say, </I>My Dinner with Andr�<I> and Sartre; </I>The Fever<I> and Euripides; </I>Aunt Dan and Lemon<I> and Freud, O'Neill, and </I>Shoah<I>.  The range of reference always brings the reader back to the texts with a refreshed and buzzing mind."</I>
