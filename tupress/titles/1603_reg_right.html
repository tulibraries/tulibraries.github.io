<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>"The book will appeal to race and legal scholars in the US as well as in the UK. The breadth of topics and methodologies covered within the volume is certainly impressive and the teaming of chapters from established academics with younger scholars give the book a fresh approach to the study of critical race theory."</i>
<br>&#151<b><i>The Journal of Ethnic and Racial Studies</i></b><i></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Its opponents call it part of "the lunatic fringe," a justification for "black separateness," "the most embarrassing trend in American publishing."  "It" is Critical Race Theory.

<p>But what is Critical Race Theory?  How did it develop?  Where does it stand now?  Where should it go in the future?  In this volume, thirty-one CRT scholars present their views on the ideas and methods of CRT, its role in academia and in the culture at large, and its past, present, and future.

<p>Critical race theorists assert that both the procedures and the substance of American law are structured to maintain white privilege.  The neutrality and objectivity of the law are not just unattainable ideals; they are harmful actions that obscure the law's role in protecting white supremacy.  This notion&#151so obvious to some, so unthinkable to others&#151has stimulated and divided legal thinking in this country and, increasingly, abroad.

<p>The essays in <I>Crossroads, Directions, and a New Critical Race Theory</I>&#151all original&#151address this notion in a variety of helpful and exciting ways.  They use analysis, personal experience, historical narrative, and many other techniques to explain the importance of looking critically at how race permeates our national consciousness.

<P><p><I>"The book is a must-read for those who are interested in the genesis of CRT [Critical Race Theory], in how CRT positions itself against other legal discourses, and in the current debates within the CRT literature."</I>
<br>&#151<b><I>Yale Law Journal</I></b>

<p><I>"The essays are a snapshot of a sprawling, unruly, and sometimes fractious field. Meant to evaluate the first ten years of critical race theory's development, the book truly captures a discipline at the crossroads, struggling with how to define its substantive mission, methodological commitments, and connection to a world outside the academy."</I>
<br>&#151<b><I>Stanford Law Review</I></b>

<p><i>"On the whole, this collection will leave those of us with an investment in (and a debt to pay to) critical race theory optimistic about its future."</i>
<br>&#151<b><i>Social and Legal Studies</b></i>

<p><i>"The volume certainly offers much material for another conservative broadside against critical race theory, but by speaking their truth&#151and speaking it elegantly&#151this collection of 'outsider' academics has offered a telling and important contribution to the future."</i>
