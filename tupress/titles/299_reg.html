</P><BLOCKQUOTE><I>"This is a book on the French policy-making process, and one of its many merits is that it looks at the effectiveness of the French policy-making process without losing sight of distinctive national peculiarities.  The book demonstrates an excellent familiarity with French politics and it fits admirably into the series in which it appears."</I>
<BR>&#151<B>Ezra N. Suleiman</B>, Princeton University<I></I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Under the new socialist regime of Francois Mitterand, how much will French policymaking change?  How has it functioned under previous regimes?  How does the French process compare with policymaking in other industrial states?
<P>These are some of the questions Douglas E. Ashford considers in analyzing six major areas of domestic policymaking in France&#151administrative reform, local and regional reform, economic policy, industrial relations, social security, and immigration.  Each case is accompanied by selected readings translated from official government documents and the writings of critics of official policy, including readings from the Mitterand period.  The book offers an unusually strong point of view, one that differs from the standard interpretations of French Politics.

<P><I>Policy and Politics in France</I> is the third volume in the series, <I>Policy and Politics in Industrial States</I>, edited by Douglas E. Ashford, Peter J. Katzenstein, and T. J. Pempel. Each volume consists of a balance of provocative analysis and documents for six issues.  Four topics&#151economic policy, labor relations, social welfare, and the internal organization of the state&#151are common to all volumes; the remaining two are reserved for policy problems peculiar to the individual country.
