<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>"Chris Tilly's study of part-time work differs from, and is superior to, most others because he puts the organizations that hire part-time workers at the center of his analysis.  His ideas about part-time work are derived logically and rigorously.  This is true, most especially, of the original and useful distinction he draws between retention and secondary part-time jobs that is at the heart of the book.  </I>Half a Job<I> is original, distinctive, and significant."</I>
<br>&#151<b>Eileen Appelbaum</b>, Economic Policy Institute<I></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Over 20 million people are working part-time in the United States, more than six million of them involuntarily.  Both <i>Time</i> and <i>Fortune</i> magazines have run recent cover stories about this constrained faction of the workforce, who tend to earn on average 40 percent less than full-time workers.  Addressing this disturbing trend, Chris Tilly presents a current, in-depth analysis of how U.S. businesses use part-time employment, and why they are using it more and more.

<p>Worker demand for part-time jobs peaked more than twenty years ago, but employers' desires for cheap labor and schedule flexibility have continued to drive the long-term growth of part-time jobs.  Tilly argues that this growth is a reaction to the expanding trade and service industries, which, by their nature, depend on part-time workers.  Examining the nature and purposes of the different types of part-time employment, he explores the roots of part-time jobs in the organization of work, and the inadequacies of existing public policies on part-time employment.

<p>Using not only statistical analysis but over eighty interviews with employers in the retail and insurance industries, Tilly suggests new approaches to providing flexibility without insecurity.

<P><p><I>"In the 1990s, for every person officially counted as 'unemployed,' at least one more person is involuntarily working part-time.  These are the workers with only half a job.  And their ranks are growing.  In this important and compassionate book, scholar-activist Christ Tilly tells us why&#151and why it matters to the American standard of living."</I>
<br>&#151<b>Bennett Harrison</b>, Harvard University

<p><I>"Companies are creating part-time jobs even though workers don't want them.  Why are they doing this?  In </I>Half a Job<I>, Tilly takes on this question and through rigorous documentation helps to make sense of the eroding situation of the U.S. worker.  For those seeking to understand the growth of part-time work as well as those attempting to organize and represent the new contingent work force, Tilly's book is a valuable contribution."</I>
<br>&#151<b>John J. Sweeney</b>, President of the Service Employees International Union

<p><i>"</i>In Half a Job<i>, Chris Tilly seeks answers to some fundamental questions about this labor market phenomenon: why part-time employment has grown, what kinds of part-time jobs exist, and how businesses make decisions about and use part-time workers..... Operating with few legal constraints, companies have many staffing options, and Tilly's skillful blending of qualitative and quantitative information helps us to understand the choices they make."</i>

<p><i>"...someone wanting to understand the nature of part-time employment can do no better than Tilly's book. The analysis is careful and even handed. Even more impressive is the bag of tools that Tilly employs to construct a picture of part-time employment. It is a model for how empirical research should be conducted."</i>
