</P></td></tr></table><BR><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>"Anyone considering a new method of conception or struggling to resolve infertility should read this book.  The authors point to the need for more public discussion of infertility and more social support groups for the infertile.  Reading and discussing this book is a first step.  It is also an excellent supplementary text for courses in human sexuality, sex and gender roles, women and society, or medical ethics, and is guaranteed to provoke lively class discussion."</I>
<br>&#151<b><I>Contemporary Sociology</I></b><I></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><p>This revised and updated edition provides an accessible discussion of how new reproductive technologies work and how well they work.  Includes gripping personal and professional accounts from infertility specialists and would-be parents who have used in vitro fertilization, donor insemination, surrogacy, and other technologies.  Would-be parents speak candidly about the difficult process&#151repeated office visits, frequent tests, and anxious waiting for results&#151and the staggering costs&#151in dollars, stress, and physical consequences.</p>
<BR><H2 class="inpageheading">Reviews</h2><p>
<p><I>"This book will be useful for several audiences.  Infertile women and men considering the new reproductive technologies will find this book an invaluable resource.  Health professionals working with infertility patients will find that the book offers helpful insights into the experiences and concerns of their clients.  Finally, researchers studying infertility will find this book to be a rich source of interesting hypotheses."</I>
<br>&#151<b><I>Contemporary Psychology</I></b>

<p><I>"Lasker and Borg present a thoughtful and sensitive examination of the world of the new reproductive technologies.  Most importantly, they offer us the voices of the women and men who have </I>been there:<I> in infertility clinics, in </I>in vitro<I> programs, in so-called 'surrogacy' contracts.  They share with us the success and failure, joy and grief of our brave new world of reproduction."</I>
