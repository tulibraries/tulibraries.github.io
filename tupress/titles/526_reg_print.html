</P></td></tr></table><BR><P><p>In this ethnographic account of longshoremen in California, William Finlay examines how they have been affected by recent technological changes in this industry. Focusing on the workers in Local 13 (Los Angeles-Long Beach) of the ILWU, he finds that despite the profound impact of new technologies, in particular of containerization, these workers have retained much of their influence over production, their autonomy at work, and their skill on the job. 

<p>Using data collected from interviews and participant observation, Finlay provides a first-hand view of a union, the International Longshoremen’s and Warehousemen’s Union, about which there has been considerable speculation and discussion but which has been quite difficult for outsiders to penetrate. During his research, Finlay worked as a longshoreman, accompanied crane operators loading and unloading ships, observed union business agents on their waterfront rounds, and attended negotiation meetings.

<p>Contrary to many contemporary arguments concerning the negative impact of technological innovation at the workplace, Finlay finds that in longshoring the new technologies have resulted in the increased demand for skilled workers and in fresh opportunities for workers to assert their control of production. <I>Work on the Waterfront</I> examines local unionism in action and discusses the factors that produce on-the-job bargaining in longshoring and other lines of work.</p>
