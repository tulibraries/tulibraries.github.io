</P><p>In the sub-field of world history, there has been a surprising paucity of thinking and writing about how to approach and conceptualize the long twentieth century from the 1870s through the early 2000s. The historiographic essays collected in <em>Essays on Twentieth-Century History</em> will go a long way to filling that lacuna.
</p><p>
Each contribution covers a key theme and one or more critical sub-fields in twentieth century global history. Chapters address migration patterns, the impact of world wars, transformations in gender and urbanization, as well as environmental transitions. All are written by leading historians in each of the sub-fields represented, and each is intended to provide an introduction to the literature, key themes, and debates that have proliferated around the more recent historical experience of humanity.
</p><p>
<em>Essays on Twentieth-Century History</em> is an essential collection for scholars and students who wish to understand the recent past. 
 </p><p>
Contributors include: Paul Edwards, Carl J. Guarneri, Gabrielle Hecht, Adam McKeown, John H. Morrow, Jr., Jose C. Moya, Jean H. Quataert, Bonnie Smith, Howard Spodek, Robin Tucker, and the editor.

<BR>&nbsp;<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p><I>"This collection of essays is part of a larger attempt to overturn the problematic periodization of the twentieth century that�at least in the schema of the global narrative�tends to serve as a coda to the nineteenth century.... </I>Essays on Twentieth-Century History</I> has considerable value in teaching at both the graduate and undergraduate levels. In both instances, the collection challenges readers to reconsider�or perhaps consider�the significance of the twentieth century in the still-developing narrative of global history. The various essays are accessible, provocative, and with many essays offering essential bibliographies, they represent a starting point for historians and historians in training."</I>

</p><p><i>Critical Perspectives on the Past</i>, edited by Susan Porter Benson, Stephen Brier, and Roy Rosenzweig, is concerned with the traditional and nontraditional ways in which historical ideas are formed.  In its attentiveness to issues of race, class, and gender and to the role of human agency in shaping events, the series is as critical of traditional historical method as content.  Emphasizing that history is itself an interpretation of material events, the series demonstrates that the historian's choices of subject, narrative technique, and documentation are politically as well as intellectually constructed.</p>
