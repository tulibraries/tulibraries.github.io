</P><BLOCKQUOTE><I>"[This] book is a significant addition to the field of service-learning and civic engagement in higher education and should become a standard resource. The authors are arguably the two most significant thought leaders in service-learning and civic engagement today, and the breadth and depth of their assembled essays�on issues of definition and rationale, models, on-the-ground implementation, institutional change, future directions�are remarkable. </i>Higher Education and Democracy<i> does an admirable job of illustrating the evolution and complexity of the authors' thinking regarding the most significant issues facing the field."</I><br>&#151<b>Patti H. Clayton</b>,  Consultant (PHC Ventures) and Senior Scholar with the Center for Service and Learning at Indiana University�Purdue University Indianapolis</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p><em>Higher Education and Democracy</em> is a collection of essays on how civic engagement in higher education works to achieve what authors John Saltmarsh and Edward Zlotkowski consider the academic and civic purposes of higher education. These purposes include creating new modes of teaching and learning, fostering participation in American democracy, developing and respecting community and civic institutions, and encouraging the constant renewal of all these dimensions of American life.</p>

<p>Organized thematically, the twenty-two essays in this volume provide signposts designed to advance higher education�s journey toward fulfilling these civic purposes. For the authors, service-learning is positioned as centrally important to the primary academic systems and structures of higher education: departments, disciplines, curricula, and programs that are central to the faculty domain. Progressing from more general and contextual themes to specific practices embodied in ever larger academic units, the authors conclude with observations on the future of the civic engagement movement. </p>

<P>Contributors include <I>Donna Killian Duffy</I>, <I>John N. Gardner</I>, <I>Ira Harkavy</I>, <I>Barbara A. Holland</I>, <I>Kevin Kecskes</I>, <I>Keith Morton</I>, <I>KerryAnn O�Meara</I>, <I>R. Eugene Rice</I>, and the authors.
<BR>&nbsp;<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p><i>"This is a valuable resource for professors and administrators in higher education using or supporting service learning." </i><br>&#151<b><i>Library Journal</i></b>

<p><i>"The complete work serves as a useful tool for academics, administrators, and staff members to understand the historical roots of the service-learning movement. The authors� experiences presented in this collection elucidate the persistent obstacles confronting those who seek to fulfill higher education�s civic mission through the scholarship of engagement. The work provides tangible suggestions for overcoming those obstacles through a plethora of examples; however, its strongest contribution is its argument for the development of a new engaged epistemology that parallels Ernest Boyer�s (1996) scholarship of engagement.... The book serves as a valuable resource for those faculty, staff, and administrators interested in developing an academic environment that promotes civic engagement using service-learning as the bridge 'between institutional rhetoric and institutional action, between professed values and actual practice." </i><br>&#151<b><i>The Journal of Higher Education Outreach and Engagement</i></b>

<p><i>"[D]ramatically convey[ing] the hopes and concerns that animated the movement from the mid-1990s to the late 2000s...these lively and argumentative essays' significance is illuminated by prefaces commenting on the context in which each one was written.... The essays that follow are good reading."</i> <br>&#151<b><i>Change</i></b>

<p><i>"These essays provide readers with a rich glimpse of the foundations, evolution, diverse implementation models, examples of institutional change, and future of the service-learning and civic engagement movement.... [T]he readings are organized to show clearly both the complexity and the promise that pedagogies of engagement, such as service-learning, offer and why community engagement is strengthened when framed by a purposive civic intent." </i><br>&#151<b><i>Metropolitan Universities Journal</i></b>

<p><i>"The arrangement of the essays is excellent, building upon each other and providing tools for navigating this pedagogy. The authors first create a sense of need and urgency for civic engagement in higher education.... From beginning to end, this collection of essays provides a variety of perspectives, information, and examples that will move higher education institutions toward a more civically engaged society through educating future leaders." </i><br>&#151<b><i>The Review of Higher Education </i></b>
