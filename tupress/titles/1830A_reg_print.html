<BR><H2 class="inpageheading">Reviews</h2><p>
<p><i>"Among the things that make </i>The New Eagles Encyclopedia<i> a must-have for all who bleed green is the entertainingly written summaries of every playoff game � good, bad and ugly; a complete summary of Andy Reid�s tenure as head coach (his 140 wins are, by far, the most in team history); new entries on coach Chip Kelly, former quarterback Michael Vick and stars Nick Foles and LeSean McCoy; a new chapter on the rivalry with the hated Dallas Cowboys; and expanded, feel-good chapters on hall of fame Eagles and milestone moments in team history, both good and controversial.... The photos are a treat too.... </i>The New Eagles Encyclopedia<i> doubles as the ultimate fan argument-settler, and a soothing balm for after those inevitable losses to remind you that things will get better."</i>
<br>&#151<b><i>Bucks County Local News</i></b>

<p><i> "Didinger isn't just one of the most knowledgeable pro football experts on this planet, he's one of the game's very best writers.... That explains the effortless lilt and flow of the prose in a tome of 440 pages. It concentrates not as much on games as on people, a lot of good and interesting people the author knows well.... For not just Eagles fans but anyone looking for a great read."</i><br>&#151<b><i>Patriot-News</i></b>

<p>Praise for the First Edition

<p><i>"</i>The Eagles Encyclopedia<i> is terrific precisely because it couldn't be any more about sports or football. Written by two of the biggest Eagles experts around, </i>EE<i> is loaded with stats, team history, informative profiles, and plenty of trivia (including the fact that the 1980 Birds were the first team in NFL history to receive a papal blessing). If you don't care about the Eagles, stay away&#151you'll find no lessons about the human condition here. But if the Birds make your life worth living, this is a great way to fill those stretches between football Sundays."</i>
<br>&#151<b>Jack Corcoran</b>, <i>Philadelphia Magazine</i>

<p><i>"Whether it's the birth of the Eagles, the profiles of the players, or the history of the stadiums, it's all a joy to read and full of anything you ever wanted to know about the Eagles&#151and then some."</i>
<br>&#151<b><i>The Camden Courier-Post</i></b>

<p><i>"No true Eagles fan should be without it."</i>
<br>&#151<b>KYW's Bill Campbell</b>
