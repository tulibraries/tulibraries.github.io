<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>"Deborah Willis has used the photograph as a way of introducing memory in a provocative way. As a photographer and educator, she has created a new voice in this field and also introduced new approaches to critiquing the black woman's experience through photography and literature. </i>Black Venus 2010<i> is an important book, a significant one, which will highlight a revised visual history of black women—not only of Sarah Baartman but of other women in America and throughout the African diaspora. The images are compelling, the descriptions are engaging and accessible, and the essays and prose represent an innovative mix of analysis and cultural history. The quality and character of this collection are distinctive."</I>
<br>&#151<b>Dr. Isolde Brielmaier</b>, Vassar College <I></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>As a young South African woman of about twenty, Saartjie Baartman, the so-called &quot;Hottentot Venus,&quot; was brought to London and placed on exhibit in 1810. Clad in the Victorian equivalent of a body stocking, and paraded through the streets and on stage in a cage she became a human spectacle in London and Paris. Baartman’s distinctive physique became the object of ridicule, curiosity, scientific inquiry, and desire until and after her premature death. The figure of Sarah Baartman was reduced to her sexual parts. </p>

<p><em>Black Venus 2010</em> traces Baartman’s memory in our collective histories, as well as her symbolic history in the construction and identity of black women as artists, performers, and icons. The wide-ranging essays, poems, and images in <em>Black Venus 2010 </em>represent some of the most compelling responses to Baartman. Each one grapples with the enduring legacy of this young African woman who forever remains a touchstone for black women.

<P><p><i>"Willis (Posing Beauty) offers a comprehensive, inclusive, and coherently organized anthology that embraces 'scholarly and lyrical, historical and reflexive' responses to Baartman, as a woman, as a black woman, as an object, as an icon, as an inspiration to creative artists, and as a catalyst to scholars. The book moves from Baartman's life and times to an assessment of the figure of the “Hottentot Venus” in contemporary art and a broader consideration of the historic public display of black women. Appended is a photo gallery that is as essential and diverse as the texts. This remarkable volume satisfies the academic reader with scholarly essays and moves the general reader with its creative expression, making it fascinating and accessible to any one." </i><br>&#151<b><i>Publishers Weekly</b></i>

<p><i>"Consisting of scholarly essays, poetical works, roundtable discussions, fictional reimaginings and historiographical research, Deborah Willis' outstanding edited collection, </i>Black Venus 2010<i> is a radical tour de force... An invaluable addition to scholarship, Willis's [book] showcases a breathtaking array of forms and approaches to investigate Sarah Baartman's proliferating social, political aesthetic and historical identities."</i><br>&#151<b><i>The International Review of African American Art </b></i>

<p><i>"</i>Black Venus 2010<i> is a necessary and much-anticipated academic reader.... Willis's fascinating collection challenges us to continue to read Baartman's many iterations and forever contemplate how an ordinary black woman with an ample behind rocked the foundation of a nation." </i><br>&#151<b><i>African American Review</b></i>

<p><i>"Willis has compiled a truly interdisciplinary analysis of the life and image of Sarah Baartman, the so-called 'Hottentot Venus.'... [The] inclusion of poetry and visual art provides an added metaphysical dimension that complements the scholarly articles in this book."</i><br><b>&#151<i>American Studies</i></b></p>
