Building on recent scholarship that has revolutionized research on social movements in the last decades, this book stands out for its careful attention to the role of emotions in social movements as well as to various dilemmas that militants and movements face. This contribution is a must-read for social scientists interested in stimulating and studying social change."</i> <br>&#151<b>Michele Lamont</b>, Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, Harvard University, and co-editor (with Nissim Mizrachi) of <i>Responses to Stigmatization in Comparative Perspective</i></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><P>Collective identities are politically necessary, or at least useful, as banners for recruiting others and engaging opponents and the state. However, not every member fits or accepts the label in the same way or to the same degree. <I>The Identity Dilemma</I> provides eight diverse case studies of social movements to show the benefits, risks, and tradeoffs when a group develops a strong sense of collective identity. 
 
<P>The editors and contributors to this pathbreaking volume examine how collective identities can provide powerful advantages but also generate conflicts. The various chapters help to develop our understanding of collective identity from how strategic identities are developed for protest groups to how stigmatized groups negotiate identity dilemmas. 

<P>Ultimately, <I>The Identity Dilemma</I> contributes a new strategic approach to understanding social movements that highlights the choices and tensions that groups inevitably face in articulating their ideas and interests.

<P><I>Contributors include: Marian Barnes, Cristina Flesher Fominaya, Umut Korkut, Elzbieta Korolczuk, John Nagle, Clare Saunders, Neil Stammers, Marisa Tramontano, Huub Van Baar, and the editors.</I></p>

<p>"The Identity Dilemma <i>brings numerous scholars together to take a current look at social movements and the issues collective identity formation pose for such groups....Through a cross-disciplinary, Western-oriented investigation, their volume demonstrates how collective identities continue to have such importance today. In fact, one strength is the breadth in investigations this volume provides.... </i>The Identity Dilemma <i> is unique for encouraging the employment of more methods of inquiry in the study of social movements.... (T)he tour de force discussion of the social movement literature...makes it a great introduction to the subject for graduates and upper level undergraduates.</i>"<br/> &#8212;<b><i>New Political Science</i></b><p><br>
