<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>"</i>Black Theatre<i> is an indispensable volume&#151insightful, wide-ranging, global in scope&#151to be enjoyed, studied, mulled over and argued with."</i>
<br>&#151<b>Douglass Turner Ward</b>, Founder of The Negro Ensemble Company<i></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Generating a new understanding of the past&#151as well as a vision for the future&#151this path-breaking volume contains essays written by playwrights, scholars, and critics that analyze African American theatre as it is practiced today.

<p>Even as they acknowledge that Black experience is not monolithic, these contributors argue provocatively and persuasively for a Black consciousness that creates a culturally specific theatre. This theatre, rooted in an African mythos, offers ritual rather than realism; it transcends the specifics of social relations, reaching toward revelation. The ritual performance that is intrinsic to Black theatre renews the community; in Paul Carter Harrison's words, it "reveals the Form of Things Unknown" in a way that "binds, cleanses, and heals."

<P><p><I>"In 1970, in the heat of the Black Arts Movement, Paul Carter Harrison published his seminal </I>The Drama of Nommo<I>, challenging readers to look beyond the political orthodoxy of kitchen sink realism to discern the aesthetic foundations of black theatre.  This present anthology demonstrates the impressive extent to which scholars, playwrights, and directors have built upon that call.  Drawing from performance practices in Africa, the Caribbean, the United States, and black Britain, this landmark collection delineates the cultural specificity of an African diaspora theatre that, while it appears to 'wear the mask' of conformity to EuroAmerican values, enacts a profoundly different world view aimed at confronting an oppressive past and reaffirming the humanity of black peoples.  The anthology's analytic rigor and creative insight set a challenge for subsequent generations to engage."</I>
<br>&#151<b>Sandra L. Richards</b>, Leon Forrest Professor of African American Studies and Professor of Theatre and Performance Studies at Northwestern University

<p><i>"The spirit and the intellect of the late Larry Neal, as well as the tremendously resilient legacy of the radical Black theatre movement of the sixties and seventies, animate most of the essays and documents collected in this volume.  It is a feast of powerful critical and theoretical reflections on the past and the future of Black theatre in this country and in other parts of the African diaspora.  Without the slightest nudge toward racial absolutism or essentialism, the volume is a model of how 'race' can be deployed as a subtle and progressive analytic category in contemporary dramatic and cultural criticism.  This book should be compulsory reading for every student of contemporary theatre scholarship."</i>
<br>&#151<b>Biodun Jeyifo</b>, Professor of English, Cornell University

<p><i>"...a powerful examination of ritual-based performance traditions practiced throughout the African diaspora. It belongs on the shelf of anyone studying black performance.
