<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>"An excellent collection of papers covering the feminist movements in seven Western democracies (the United States, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Britain, West Germany and Sweden) at the beginning of the 1980s."</I>
<br>&#151<b><I>International Affairs</I></b><I></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Although many of the social movements born in the 1960s and 1970s have expired, the feminist movement is one of the few survivors. Yet the relative infrequence of protests, demonstrations, and marches, the dissolution of the earlier consciousness-raising groups and the more audible self-criticism within the movement has signaled to some movement-watchers that contemporary feminism has spent its force. Obviously, there is a need to gauge exactly where the women’s movement stands today. This book seeks to fill a gap in feminist scholarship by focusing on the women’s movements and the different opportunities their political environments provide. Offering comparisons of the feminist movements in seven countries, the essays seek to assess the power and potential of the feminist movement in Western Europe and the United States.

<P><p><I>"The collection includes a variety of approaches and methods for examining the problems proposed by the editors, including descriptions of policymaking processes, elite interviewing, and opinion surveys.  The various papers are all well-conceived....  A rare common perspective, or consciousness, [is] shared by the authors and indicates careful preparation by the editors."</I>
