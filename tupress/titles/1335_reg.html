<BLOCKQUOTE><I>"A pioneering anthology, this book foregrounds ethnography's pivotal contributions to critical inquiry in Asian American Studies, Ethnic Studies and American Studies.  The essays articulate the dilemmas and possibilities that arise when minoritarian subjects write about our own communities, adding fresh voices to contemporary discussions of ethnography in Cultural Studies and in the social sciences."</I>

<P><I>Cultural Compass</I> rewrites the space of Asian Americans.  Through innovative studies of community politics, gender, family and sexual relations, cultural events, and other sites central to the formation of ethnic and citizen identity, contributors reconfigure ethnography according to Asian American experiences in the United States.  In these eleven essays, scholars in anthropology, sociology, ethnic studies, and Asian American studies reconsider traditional models for ethnographic research.

<P>Drawing upon recent theoretical discussions and methodological innovations, the contributors explore the construction and displacement of self, community, and home integral to Asian American cultural journeys in the late twentieth century.  Some discuss the unique situation of doing ethnographic work "at home"&#151that is researching one's own ethnic group or another group within Asian America.  Others draw on rich and diverse field experiences.  Whether they are doing homework or fieldwork, contributors reflect on the ways that particular matters of identity&#151gender, class, sexuality, ethnicity, age&#151play out between researchers and informants.  Individual essays and the book as a whole challenge the notion of a monolithic, spatially bounded Asian American community, pointing the way to multiple sites of political struggle, cultural critique, and social change.

<BR>&nbsp;<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p><i>"</I>Cultural Compass<I> is a thought-provoking collection that effectively stages ethnography as a means of interrogating bounded notions of community and identity, setting new terrains of debate for the geographies of transnationalism and its study.  It promises to be of great value not only for Asian American Studies and Anthropology, but for interdisciplinary work in Cultural Studies, Ethnic Studies and Diaspora Studies as well."</i>
<br>&#151<b>Kamala Visweswaran</b>, Associate Professor of Anthropology, University of Texas at Austin

<p><i>"Innovative, informative, and intelligent, the essays in the collection reconfigure ethnography according to the experiences of Asians in the United States.  Individually, they provide incisive portraits of the various Asian American communities; collectively, they chart new directions for a critical Asian American ethnography that attends to multiple strategies and readings and to multiple sites of political struggles, cultural practices, and social activism."</i>

Scott Wong, Linda Trinh Võ, and Cathy Schlund-Vials.
</p><p>Founded by Sucheng Chan in 1991, the <I>Asian American History and Culture</I>, series has sponsored innovative scholarship that has redefined, expanded, and advanced the field of Asian American studies while strengthening its links to related areas of scholarly inquiry and engaged critique. Like the field from which it emerged, the series remains rooted in the social sciences and humanities, encompassing multiple regions, formations, communities, and identities. Extending the vision of founding editor Sucheng Chan and emeriti editor Michael Omi and David Palumbo-Liu, series editors K. Scott Wong, Linda Trinh Võ, and Cathy Schlund-Vials continue to develop a foundational collection that embodies a range of theoretical and methodological approaches to Asian American studies.</p>
