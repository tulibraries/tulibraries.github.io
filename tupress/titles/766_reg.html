<BLOCKQUOTE><I>"My aim is the total Merz art work, which combines all genres into an artistic unity.  First I married off single genres.  I pasted words and sentences together in poems in such a way that their rhythmic composition created a kind of drawing.  The other way around, I pasted together pictures and drawings containing sentences that demand to be read....  I did this in order to erase the boundaries between the arts."</I>
<br>&#151<b>Kurt Schwitters</b><I></I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Although Kurt Schwitters (1887-1948) is increasingly recognized as one of the great visual artists of the twentieth century&#151a recognition reconfirmed in 1985 by a highly acclaimed retrospective at New York's Museum of Modern Art&#151his achievements as one of the major poets and theorists of Modernism have not received the same degree of attention.  This collection of Schwitters' literary work, presented by two American poets of international standing, brings the vast range and unique genius of his writings to English-language audiences for the first time.

<p>Coining the word "Merz" to identify his one-man version of Dadism, Schwitters sought to "erase the boundaries between the arts" and to emphasize the reciprocal relationship of his visual and verbal works.  Schwitters worked with and developed more new forms and genres than almost any poet of his time.  The wide sweep and inventiveness of his literary output&#151essays, plays, fiction, manifestos, as well as poetry&#151reflect or prefigure movements such as expressionism, surrealism, sound-texts, concrete poetry, performance art, and language poetry.

<p>To present Schwitters' astounding range, the poet-translators of this volume have selected poems, "proses," performance pieces, and manifestos; included complete major works, such as "Augusta Bolte" and "Ur Sonata"; offered selections from Schwitters' plays; and provided a sampler of the collaged and word-filled paintings (some in full color).
<BR>&nbsp;<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p><I>"Alone, the artist's work would remain equally strong and radical, but I think it is fortunate that his work fell into the hands of Joris and Rothenberg....The[y] provide a clear historical background while establishing the importance and current validity of Schwitters' written work."</I>
<br>&#151<b><I>American Book Review</I></b>

<p><I>"Jerome Rothenberg and Pierre Joris, themselves important poets, have given us a wonderfully supple idiomatic translation of Schwitters' major poems, fictions, and plays.  Form the radical language experiments of the early twenties&#151'An Anna Blume' and the 'Ur Sonata' are cited in virtually every book-length study of Dada and European avant-garde&#151to the later plays and the </I>Merz<I> manifestos, Rothenberg and Joris have done wonders in conveying the tone and pace of Schwitters' poetic and performance pieces.  Anyone who cares about the Modernist avant-garde will want to own this book, and its critical apparatus makes it ideal for classroom use."</I>

</p><p><I>Border Lines</I>, edited by Lawrence Venuti, is a translation series designed to make important foreign literary works available to an English-language audience and to recognize and support the role of translation in promoting cultural diversity.  The books will be primarily fiction and poetry, but the series will also consider drama and non-fiction genres like memoirs and criticism.  Preference will be given to foreign writers who have never been translated into English, and to foreign literatures that are underrepresented in Anglo-American culture because of aesthetic, cultural, or political differences.</p>
