<p><a href="../authors/1675_qa.html" target="_top">Q&A with William Quigley, 2003</a>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>"Bill Quigley draws on the common sense of Thomas Paine, the moral inspiration of Martin Luther King, Jr., and the political wisdom of Franklin Delano Roosevelt to issue a bold challenge for our society: to guarantee people who want to work the right to a job at a living wage. In a brave and witty book that is both visionary and practical, Quigley reminds us that if once radical ideas like social security and the abolition of slavery can become realities, then the current partnership between poverty and work can be upended too."</i>
<br>&#151<b>Lani Guinier</b>, Professor of Law and co-author of <i>The Miner's Canary</i><i></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Across the United States tens of millions of people are working forty or more hours a week...and living in poverty. This is surprising in a country where politicians promise that anyone who does their share, and works hard, will get ahead.  In <i>Ending Poverty As We Know It</i>, William Quigley argues that it is time to make good on that promise by adding to the Constitution language that insures those who want to work can do so&#151and at a wage that enables them to afford reasonable shelter, clothing, and food.

<P><p><i>"Bill Quigley's book makes us believe that America can really change for the better and provide a decent job and a fair wage to hard-working families.  This is a very important book.  Bill brings a lifetime of knowledge and commitment to this; and he really shows us, step by step, how it can be done."</i>
<br>&#151<b>Sister Helen Prejean</b>, social activist and author of <i>Dead Man Walking</i>

<p><i>"Quigley, an active public interest lawyer and law professor, makes a good case for a constitutional amendment that requires a living wage job for everyone. ...a timely and interesting topic that makes for good reading. Highly recommended."</i>
<br>&#151<b><i>Choice</i></b>

<p><i>"While it will not solve America's poverty crisis, Quigley's book stands as a call to arms to the American public to act, to think, and to consider his proposal not just for the sake of charity, but for the sake of the country."</i>
<br>&#151<b><i>Berkeley Journal of Employment and Labor Law</i></b>

<p><i>"[T]imely and significant.... [Quigley] proceeds to make a strong case..."</i>
<br>&#151<b><i>Labor Studies Journal</i></b>

<p><i>"You should check it out, even if you're too busy trying to make ends meet. The book is full of facts kept safely away from the consciousness of the voting public."</i>
<br>&#151<b>Sean Gonsalves</b>, <i>Cape Cod Times</i></p>
