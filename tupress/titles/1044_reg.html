</P><BLOCKQUOTE><I>"</I>Women and Film<I>'s scope and depth, its variety&#151from cultural criticism to one on one interviews&#151reflect an important new direction in the changing attitudes and debates that surround the representation of women in all aspects of contemporary cinema."</I>
<br>&#151<b>Susan Seidelman</b><I></I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Brought together for the first time, these lively, sophisticated essays bring into focus contemporary debates regarding the representation of women in film and analyze women's practices as filmmakers and actors.  <I>Sight and Sound</I>, the pioneering magazine of film criticism, has enlisted a distinguished group of cultural commentators&#151critics, scholars, novelists&#151to consider the roles of gender and sexuality in classic and recent cinema.

<p>Like <I>Sight and Sound</I> itself, the essays in this book are international in scope and represent the newest perspectives in cultural theory and criticism in a readily accessible style.  Challenging dominant myths and the status quo in the industry, these provocative writers consider a wide range of fascinating topics that define the boundaries of traditional cinema and explore unmapped territory.

<p>Essays are generously illustrated with stills of films discussed, and each section contains a comprehensive bibliography and filmography.

<BR>&nbsp;<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p><I>"This is a delightful collection of essays&#151smart, witty, socially informed and on-target.  In its delicate, and all too rare, balance of intellectual sophistication and stylistic grace and accessibility, it offers a treat to both the general reader and the student of gender and film theory."</I>

</p><p>The <I>Culture and the Moving Image</I> series, edited by Robert Sklar, seeks to publish innovative scholarship and criticism on cinema, television, and the culture of the moving image.  The series will emphasize works that view these media in their broad cultural and social frameworks.  Its themes will include a global perspective on the world-wide production of images; the links between film, television, and video art; a concern with issues of race, class, and gender; and an engagement with the growing convergence of history and theory in moving image studies.</p>
