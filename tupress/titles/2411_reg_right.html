<BLOCKQUOTE> <p>"Addressing Violence Against Women on College Campuses <em> is an innovative book whose publication will be enthusiastically welcomed by scholars, service providers, and victim advocates. The editors and contributors provide comprehensive perspectives&#8212;including Federal actions, intervention efforts, and student activism&#8212;towards preventing gender-based violence, from stalking to dating violence to unwanted sexual penetration (rape). Weaving in research findings, the chapters critically examine action steps currently mandated and in place and provide a call to action to move forward in addressing and preventing violence against college women."</em><br>

<P><p>Violence against women on college campuses has remained underreported and often under addressed by both campus security and local law enforcement, as well as campus administrators. The researchers, practitioners, and activists who contribute to the pertinent volume <i>Addressing Violence Against Women on College Campuses </i>examine the extent, nature, dynamic and contexts of violence against women at institutions of higher education.<br>
<p>This book is designed to facilitate an ongoing discussion and provide direction on how best to prevent and investigate violence against women, and intervene to assist victims while reducing the impact of these crimes. Chapters detail the necessary changes and implications that are part of Title IX and other federal legislation and initiatives as well as the effect these changes have had for higher education actors, including campus administrators, victim advocates, and student activists. The contributors also explore the importance of campus efforts to estimate the extent of violence against women; educating young men and women on the nature of sexual and dating violence; and shifting efforts to both make offenders accountable for their crimes and prompt all bystanders to act. <br>
<p><i>Addressing Violence Against Women on College Campuses</i> urgently argues to make violence prevention not separate from but rather an integral part of the student experience.   <br>
