<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>"An important contribution to a little understood subject, particularly admirable for the sensible and level-headed way in which it deals the strong taboos which still surround the material.  ....it will become an essential book in photographic studies, since the male nude plays an ever increasing role in contemporary subject matter."</I>
<br>&#151<b>Edward Lucie-Smith</b><I></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>While nude women are a staple of commercial and art photography, the photographed male nude  is often the target of censorship but seldom the subject of serious critical discussion. This is the  first study to examine the unique interrelation between social perceptions of the nude and the  medium of photography. Melody Davis focuses on the work of six artists whose photography  confronts societal prohibitions. In order to understand the taboo and silence which surrounds this  subject, she addresses the many social and cultural fears that inhibit the presentation and  discussion of photographed male nudity. Because she deals with distinctions between the nude and the naked, the interrelational and the pornographic, the book has close connections with current debates about the impact of images and the limits of public tolerance of images of  "deviance."

<p>Through the photographs of Robert Mapplethorpe, Lucas Samaras, John Coplans, George Dureau, Joel-Peter Witkin, and a film by Dusan Makavejev, the author examines how the action  ideal for the male body is challenged by an artistic medium in which man becomes the spectacle, not the spectator. By presenting three of photography's genres&#151self-portraiture, portraits of others, and allegorical nudes&#151Davis is able to reveal the critical and theoretical issues which shape our understanding of photographed nudity, and, by extension, representations of gender.

</p><p><I>Visual Studies</I>, edited by Douglas Harper, will consist of a broad range of books that regard photography, film, and other visual media as vehicles for exploring social and cultural themes.  We are developing a series of illustrated books that draw on photographs as primary documents and that include a substantial analytic text; however, we will also consider unillustrated manuscripts on visual subjects.  Douglas Harper is a photographer and sociologist who teaches at Potsdam College of the State University of New York.</p>
