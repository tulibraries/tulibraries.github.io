They should also address some questions for the field of Asian studies, whose practitioners are now wondering out loud how, precisely by internationalizing themselves, Asian Americans, given their biculturalism and transnationality, might help frame new approaches to the study of Asia and its subjects."</I>
<BR>&#151<B>Evelyn Hu-DeHart</B>, from the Introduction<I></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><p><i>Across the Pacific</i> explores in descriptive and critical ways how transnational relationships and interactions in Asian American communities are manifested, exemplified, and articulated within the international context of the Pacific Rim. In eight ground-breaking essays, contributors address new meanings and practices of Asian Americans in the global transformation of the post-Civil Rights, post-Cold War, postmodern and postcolonial era.

<p>Asian Americans have always been a trans-Pacific community&#151and are now more than ever. Since the changes in immigration laws in 1965, after decades of exclusion from the United States, Asians are once more immigrating to the U.S. Entering the U.S. upon the culmination of the Civil Rights movement, Asians becoming Asian Americans have joined a self-consciously multicultural society. Asian economies have roared onto the world stage, creating new markets while circulating capital and labor at an unprecedented scale and intensity, thereby helping drive the forces of modern globalization. 

<p>Considering issues of diaspora, transmigrancy, assimilation, institutionalized racism, and community, <i>Across the Pacific</i> offers essays on such topics as the impact of the new migrations on Asian American subjectivity and politics, the role of Asian Americans in Pacific rim economies, and cultural expressions of dislocation among contemporary Asian American writers. It asks: If Asian Americans are to assume the role of bridge builders across the Pacific, what are the opportunities, the risks, the promises, the perils?</p>

Scott Wong, Linda Trinh V�, and Cathy Schlund-Vials.
</p><p>Founded by Sucheng Chan in 1991, the <I>Asian American History and Culture</I>, series has sponsored innovative scholarship that has redefined, expanded, and advanced the field of Asian American studies while strengthening its links to related areas of scholarly inquiry and engaged critique. Like the field from which it emerged, the series remains rooted in the social sciences and humanities, encompassing multiple regions, formations, communities, and identities. Extending the vision of founding editor Sucheng Chan and emeriti editor Michael Omi and David Palumbo-Liu, series editors K. Scott Wong, Linda Trinh V�, and Cathy Schlund-Vials continue to develop a foundational collection that embodies a range of theoretical and methodological approaches to Asian American studies.</p>
