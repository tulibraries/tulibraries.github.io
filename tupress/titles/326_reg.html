<BR></P><BLOCKQUOTE><I>"</I>Detroit<I> is a wonderfully thorough compendium of urban inequality.  It should quickly establish itself as the definitive study for Detroit-area planners and policy makers.  For teachers and students in the Detroit metropolitan region, this book will prove invaluable as a reference text.  The quantitative data are presented with minimal, but appropriate, statistical analysis, helpful maps, and well-organized tables.  The case studies of struggle for school and housing integration make up some of the most readable sections of the book and power structure research methods are sure to shed new light on such development projects as the Renaissance Center."</I>
<br>&#151<b><I>Contemporary Sociology</I></b><I></I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>As the nation shifted from the Depression to the second world war, federal involvement in urban affairs was increasing, war service was raising black expectation, and the city of Detroit was at a turning point in its socioeconomic and political development.  A controversy over a defense housing tract built for black workers and named for the black abolitionist Sojourner Truth brought into focus the conflict and complex interacting between the races, the white immigrant workers, and the local and federal government.  The dramatic story of racial attitudes and political strategies during this five-year period sets the stage for the historic riot of 1943.
<BR>&nbsp;<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p><I>"The book offers fine treatments of the rise of black political power, of the efforts to rejuvenate downtown and the waterfront, and of the debt of the city in efforts to acquire new industrial and service-oriented development.... Overall, </I>Detroit<I> ably achieves the goals of the series.  The perspective is truly interdisciplinary, reflecting the authors' backgrounds.  It is a thoroughly enjoyable geography, in the best sense of the word, of the Detroit metropolitan region."</I>
