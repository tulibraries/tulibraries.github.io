        <p>"<em>If Pennsylvania had a poet laureate, it would be Bill Ecenbarger. Throughout a long career as one of the most distinguished journalists in the state, he has captured the Commonwealth's unique spirit&#8212;in all its glory and all its eccentricity. </em>Pennsylvania Stories&#8212;Well Told<em> pulls together the best of his best stories, each impeccably researched and beautifully written. Learn about the literary great John Updike, the role of the Ku Klux Klan, a popular governor's very public fight for life, the notorious state mental hospital known as Byberry. These tales and others create a rich mosaic of Pennsylvania culture and history. I heartily recommend this book.</em>"<br>

        <P><p>With a biting mix of wonder and pride, William Ecenbarger observes that in the quirky state of Pennsylvania, the town of Mauch Chunk changed its name to Jim Thorpe&#8212;even though the famous Indian athlete never set foot in it.<br><p>A former journalist for the<i> Philadelphia Inquirer Magazine, </i>and author of the bestseller <i>Kids for Cash, </i>Ecenbarger has collected a dozen of his fascinating articles showcasing the Keystone State in <i>Pennsylvania Stories</i>&#8212;<i>Well Told. </i>He provides a history of the pencil, and considers why the first day of Pennsylvania's deer hunting season&#8212;the world's largest participatory sporting event&#8212;is an unofficial state holiday, closing schools and state offices. Ecenbarger also profiles George "Boom Boom" Zambelli, the internationally renowned pyrotechnic king, and goes driving with Pennsylvania native John Updike in rural Berks County, PA. <br><p>Other fascinating tales unfold in <i>Pennsylvania Stories, </i>from an inspiring tale of Governor Bob Casey's double organ transplant, to darker essays on the electric chair and the Ku Klux Klan, to a mile-by-mile appreciation of the Pennsylvania Turnpike. <br><p>In these weird and wonderful stories, Ecenbarger highlights just what makes Pennsylvania both eccentric and great. His book is a delightfully intriguing read for natives and curious outsiders alike.<br><P CLASS="top"><A HREF="#top">BACK TO TOP</A></P>

      <p><em>"Bill Ecenbarger&#8212;to regular </em>Inquirer<em> readers, one need say no more. Put that name on a story, and they know that what awaits them is a small masterpiece of writing, wisdom, and wit. To editors at the </em>Philadelphia Inquirer<em>, Bill Ecenbarger is a godsend&#8212;a writer who covers an inordinately wide range of topics and turns in colorful, provocative stories that you want to read out loud to anyone who will listen.</em>"<br>
