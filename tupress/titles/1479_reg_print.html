The dual focus on literature and visual art strengthens the book by suggesting connections among various Mexican intellectual circles and the cultural industries.  The result should appeal to both literary scholars and art historians."</I>

<P><p>What is the effect of a "nation"? In this age of globalization, is it dead, dying, only dormant? The essays in this groundbreaking volume use the arts in Mexico to move beyond the national and the global to look at the activity of a community continually re-creating itself within and beyond its own borders.

<p>Mexico is a particularly apt focus, partly because of the vitality of its culture, partly because of its changing political identity, and partly because of the impact of borders and borderlessness on its national character. The ten essays collected here look at a wide range of aesthetic productions&#151especially literature and the visual arts&#151that give context to how art and society interact.

<p>Steering a careful course between the nostalgia of nationalism and the insensitivity of globalism, these essays examine modernism and postmodernism in the Mexican setting. Individually, they explore the incorporation of historical icons, of vanguardism, and of international influence. From Diego Rivera to Elena Garro, from the Tlateloco massacre to the Chiapas rebellion, from mass-market fiction to the film <I>Aliens</I>, the contributors view the many sides of Mexican life as relevant to the creation of a constantly shifting national culture. Taken together, the essays look both backward and forward at the evolving effect of the Mexican nation.</p>

<BR><H2 class="inpageheading">Reviews</h2><p>
<p><I>"The diversity of these essays reveals an interlocking strength built upon a common thematic, without coming across individually as narrowly construed or atomized.  There is a wonderful overlap as well as tension between the essays, notably in the ways that the authors approach the question of representation and power in the Mexican national (and transnational) space.  The publication of this collection will come at a fortuitous moment, when academic interest in Mexican studies is breaking free of earlier agendas."</I>
