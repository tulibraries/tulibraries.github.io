<P>No one knows how many Chinese are being smuggled into the United States, but credible estimates put the number at 50,000 arrivals each year.  Astonishing as this figure is, it represents only a portion of the Chinese illegally residing in the United States.  <i>Smuggled Chinese</i> presents a detailed account of how this traffic is conducted and what happens to the people who risk their lives to reach Gold Mountain. 

<p>When the <i>Golden Venture</i> ran aground off New York's coast in 1993 and ten of the 260 Chinese on board drowned, the public outcry about human smuggling became front-page news.  Probing into the causes and consequences of this clandestine traffic, Ko-Lin Chin has interviewed more than 300 people&#151smugglers, immigrants, government officials, and business owners&#151in the United States, China and Taiwan.  Their poignant and chilling testimony describes a flourishing industry in which smugglers&#151big and little snakeheads&#151command fees as high as $30,000 to move desperate but hopeful men and women around the world.  For many who survive the hunger, filthy and crowded conditions, physical and sexual abuse, and other perils of the arduous journey, life in the United States, specifically in New York's Chinatown, is a disappointment if not a curse.  Few will return to China, though, because their families depend on the money and status gained by having a relative in the States.

<p>In <i>Smuggled Chinese</i>, Ko-Lin Chin puts a human face on this intractable international problem, showing how flaws in national policies and lax law enforcement perpetuate the cycle of desperation and suffering.  He strongly believes, however, that the problem of human smuggling will continue for as long as China's citizens are deprived of fundamental human rights and economic security.

<p><i>Smuggled Chinese</i> will engage readers interested in human rights, Asian and Asian-American studies, urban studies, and sociology.

</p><p>Founded by Sucheng Chan in 1991, the <I>Asian American History and Culture</I>, series has sponsored innovative scholarship that has redefined, expanded, and advanced the field of Asian American studies while strengthening its links to related areas of scholarly inquiry and engaged critique. Like the field from which it emerged, the series remains rooted in the social sciences and humanities, encompassing multiple regions, formations, communities, and identities. Extending the vision of founding editor Sucheng Chan and emeriti editor Michael Omi and David Palumbo-Liu, series editors K. Scott Wong, Linda Trinh Võ, and Cathy Schlund-Vials continue to develop a foundational collection that embodies a range of theoretical and methodological approaches to Asian American studies.</p>
