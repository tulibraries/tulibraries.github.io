<BLOCKQUOTE><p><i>"Mark Shiel has produced the first volume of its kind and, indeed, </i>Architectures of Revolt <i> is a must-read book on film and architecture that maps a fascinating journey into the intertwining paths between political revolution and revolutionary cinematic practices."</i><br> &#8212;<b>Richard Koeck</b>, University of Liverpool, Director of the Centre for Architecture and Visual Arts<br></BLOCKQUOTE>
	
<P><p>Coinciding with the fiftieth anniversary of the worldwide mass protest movements of 1968-against war, imperialism, racism, poverty, misogyny, and homophobia-the exciting anthology <i>Architectures of Revolt</i> explores the degree to which the real events of political revolt in the urban landscape in 1968 drove change in the attitudes and practices of filmmakers and architects alike. <br><br>In and around 1968, as activists and filmmakers took to the streets, commandeering public space, buildings, and media attention, they sought to re-make the urban landscape as an expression of utopian longing or as a dystopian critique of the established order. In <i>Architectures of Revolt</i>, the editor and contributors chronicle city-specific case studies from Paris, Berlin, Milan, and Chicago to New York, Los Angeles, Mexico City, and Tokyo. The films discussed range from avant-garde and agitprop shorts to mainstream narrative feature films. All of them share a focus on the city and, often, particular streets and buildings as places of political contestation and sometimes violence, which the medium of cinema was uniquely equipped to capture. <br><br><i>Contributors include: Stephen Barber, Stanley Corkin, Jesse Lerner, Jon Lewis, Gaetana Marrone, Jennifer Stob, Andrew Webber and the editor.</i><br>

	<p><i>"Exploring a range of global cities through the lens of film theory, urban studies, architecture, and theories of everyday life, this book is a brilliant intervention into cinema's role in the history of urban rebellions. Organized around the volatile events in and around 1968, the essays offer important new insights into how filmmakers both depicted and organized urban protests. What makes this volume especially unique is its emphasis on the city's role in shaping the space of cinema itself as a vehicle for imagining social change. Timely in every way, </i>Architectures of Revolt <i> resonates with urgent concerns about social movements, media activism, and the networked landscapes of contemporary cities."</i><br>&#8212;<b>Lynn Spigel,</b> Frances E. Willard Professor of Screen Cultures at Northwestern University, and author of <i>TV by Design: Modern Art and the Rise of Network Television</i><br>

<p><p>The <em>Urban Life, Landscape, and Policy</em> Series, edited by David Stradling, Larry Bennett, and Davarian Baldwin, was founded by the late Zane L. Miller to publish books that examine past and contemporary cities, focusing on cultural and social issues. The editors seek proposals that analyze processes of urban change relevant to the future of cities and their metropolitan regions, and that examine urban and regional planning, environmental issues, and urban policy studies, thus contributing to ongoing debates. </p></P></P></P>
