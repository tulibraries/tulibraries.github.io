</P><BLOCKQUOTE><I>"...The word </I>Los<I> became current among working-class Latinos, many of them displaced from their homelands by the global forces of capital and empire, as the name for the city in which they made their homes, a city where they hoped to find liberty and fellowship..."</i>
<br>&#151<b>from the Introduction</b><i></I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Los Angeles. A city that is synonymous with celebrity and mass-market culture, is also, according to David James, synonymous with social alienation and dispersal. In the communities of Los Angeles, artists, cultural institutions and activities exist in ways that are often concealed from sight, obscured by the powerful presence of Hollywood and its machinations.

<p>In this significant collection of original essays, <I>The Sons and Daughters of Los</I> reconstructs the city of Los Angeles with new cultural connections. Explored here are the communities that offer alternatives to the picture of L..A. as a conglomeration of studios and mass media. Each essay examines a particular piece of, or place in, Los Angeles cultural life: from the Beyond Baroque Poetry Foundation, the Woman's Building, to Highways, and LACE, as well as the achievements of these grassroots initiatives. Also included is critical commentary on important artists, including Harry Gamboa, Jr., and others whose work have done much to shape popular culture in L.A. The cumulative effect of reading this book is to see a very different city take shape, one whose cultural landscape is far more innovative and reflective of the diversity of the city's people than mainstream notions of it suggest.

<p><I>The Sons and Daughters of Los</I> offers a substantive and complicated picture of the way culture plays itself it out on the smallest scale&#151in one of the largest metropolises on earth&#151contributing to a richer, more textured understanding of the vibrancy of urban life and art.

<BR>&nbsp;<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p><i>"The predisposition for universalizing forms of taste that favor timeless over timely work&#151the sensibility evident in most professional critics and historians of culture&#151militates against the study of local, tendentious, oppositional forms of endeavor. In Los Angeles, within the belly of the beast, a flourishing oppositional culture, ignored by the dominant media, exists. This book brings to light a remarkable set of artistic, institutional, and cultural practices of exemplary value. James is an excellent writer and dedicated scholar."</i>
<br>&#151<b>Bill Nichols</b>, Professor and Director of the Graduate Program in Cinema Studies at San Francisco State University

<p><i>"This is an important, multi-vocal, innovative and definitive volume on alternative community arts and cultural spaces as they are envisaged and nurtured in Los Angeles. The city and its innovative cultural institutions have long deserved such a passionate, resonant and articulate perspective as David James provides for them here in this superlatively edited volume."</i>
<br>&#151<b>Erika Suderburg</b>, Professor, Film and Visual Culture Program and the Department of Art, University of California, Riverside

</p><p>The mission of <I>Wide Angle Books</I> is to document, chronicle, and honor those 
institutions that have worked effectively to maintain a public presence and public spaces for alternative forms of media. These books recognize that institutional support of media happens at a variety of levels in a film series, in a video distribution organization, in a transnational digital network, in a grassroots production organization and in locations across the globe. Individual volumes in the series focus on such forms of primary documentation as letters, institutional records, and oral histories, presented and contextualized by leading media history scholars.</p>
