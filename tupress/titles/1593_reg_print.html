<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>"[</I>Rubble Films<I>] will certainly come to stand as an important book on an unwritten chapter in the history of postwar German cinema.... [I]t also contributes to the specific analysis of culture as an apparatus of historical memory in postwar Germany, and does so in illuminating and intriguing ways."</I>
<br>&#151<b>Lisa Saltzman</b>, Department of History of Art, Bryn Mawr College<I></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><p>At the end of World War II, Germany was a broken nation.  Split in two and occupied by the victorious Allies, it would have to be rebuilt, literally, from the rubble of its own defeat.  Volumes of books have been published chronicling its structural and economic rebirth; this unique study reveals how Germany rebuilt itself culturally.

<p><I>Rubble Films</I> is a close look at German cinema in the immediate postwar era, and a careful examination of its relationship to Allied occupation. Shandley reveals how German film borrowed&#151both literally and figuratively&#151from its Nazi past, and how the occupied powers (specifically the US) used its position as victor to open Europe to Hollywood movie products and aesthetics.

<p>Incorporating a careful reading of several important postwar films, Shandley also discusses how the German studio system operated immediately after the war, in the east and the west, giving special focus on DEFA, the east German studio that rose during Soviet occupation.

<p>Pathbreaking in its research, <I>Rubble Films</I> sheds new light on a significant moment of German cultural rebirth, and adds a new dimension to the study of the history of film.</p>

<BR><H2 class="inpageheading">Reviews</h2><p>
<p><I>"</I>Rubble Films<I> is a deft and perceptive study of the most overlooked period in German film history.  Superbly researched and written, this complex tale of German film culture illuminates, at times brilliantly, the much larger story of East and West Germany in the shadow of World War II."</I>
<br>&#151<b>Timothy Corrigan</b>, author of <I>New German Film: The Displaced Image</I> and <I>The Films of Werner Herzog: Between Mirage and History</I>

<p><i>"His study deftly combines descriptive and analytic treatments of individual films, with a cogent reconstruction of their historical context."</i>
<br>&#151<b><i>German History</i></b>

<p><i>"A primary strength of the bok is its breadth: Shandley provides a useful survey of the rubble film that addresses a wide range of genres...in doing so, he never loses sight of his analysis of the representation of history in these films."</i>
<br>&#151<b><i>Colloquia Germanica</i></b>

<p><i>"Shandley extensively mines German secondary sources to flesh out the fascinating picture of the "rubble films" first produced in the late 1940s....Shandley's book presents a clear argument and critical evaluation of these early film initiatives."</i>
