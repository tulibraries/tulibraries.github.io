</P><p>In this updated edition, Doris Zames Fleischer and Frieda Zames expand their encyclopedic history of the struggle for disability rights in the United States, bringing us up to date with the past ten years of disability rights activism. <I>The Disability Rights Movement</I> includes a new chapter on the evolving impact of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the continuing struggle for cross-disability civil and human rights, and the changing perceptions of disability.  The authors provide a probing analysis of such topics as deinstitutionalization, housing, health care, assisted suicide, employment, education, new technologies, disabled veterans, and disability culture. Based on interviews with over one hundred activists, <I>The Disability Rights Movement</I> tells a complex and compelling story of an ongoing movement that seeks to create an equitable and diverse society, inclusive of people with disabilities.

<BR>&nbsp;<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p><i>"It is accordingly useful and timely to look at the revised version of this important book and take stock of the current political conjuncture. At the heart of this deeply rewarding book is the very simple yet transformative idea that it is structural barriers in society, both physical and attitudinal, that impair the lives of people with disabilities.... The writing is throughout sharp and clear. While not written from a radical perspective, the book is particularly strong in discussing the healthcare issues and barriers facing people with disabilities.... [An] excellent text that serves as a valuable introduction to the issues facing Americans with disabilities."</I>
<br>&#151<b><I>Socialism and Democracy</I></b>

<p><i>"[A] thorough history of the disability rights movement with a clear emphasis on discrimination against disabled individuals and their many struggles to gain access to different institutions as well as to gain rights concerning health and visibility..... </i>The Disability Rights Movement<i> is a truly great book that is useful for a wide range of readers; those working within disability communities and organizations, in the classroom, and for the layperson interested in the history of activism and disabilities."</I><br>&#151<b><I>Metapsychology </I></b>
