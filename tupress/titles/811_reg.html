</P><BLOCKQUOTE><I>"</I>Entry Denied<I> is essential reading; it greatly enriches our understanding of the life experiences and strategies of those Chinese immigrants who struggled to establish a place and community in an openly hostile and racist society."</I>
<br>&#151<b><I>China Review International</I></b><I></I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>In 1882, Congress passed a Chinese exclusion law that barred the entry of Chinese laborers for ten years. The Chinese thus became the first people to be restricted from immigrating into the United States on the basis of race. Exclusion was renewed in 1892 and 1902 and finally made permanent in 1904. Only in 1943 did Congress rescind all the Chinese exclusion laws as a gesture of goodwill towards China, an ally of the United States during World War II. <I>Entry Denied</I> is a collection of essays on how the Chinese exclusion laws were implemented and how the Chinese as individuals and as a community in the U.S. mobilized to mitigate the restrictions imposed upon them. It is the first book in English to rely on Chinese language sources to explore the exclusion era in Chinese American history.
<BR>&nbsp;<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p><I>"Sucheng Chan has edited a book which...should prove to be an excellent resource for scholars and laypersons alike.  Especially interesting and useful is the legal history and analyses of decisions of the lower Federal Courts and the United States Supreme Court, which provide fresh information on the struggle of the Chinese against exclusion laws."</I>
<br>&#151<b><I>The Journal of Asian Studies</I></b>

<p><I>"This volume is a contribution to the field of Chinese American history and reflects the 'new' scholarship in Asian American Studies.... [E]ach essay, in its own emphasis, reveals how Chinese immigrants were active participants in the making of American history, challenging a repressive system on many fronts....  This volume helps to illuminate Chinese America's place in the struggle for civil rights in the U.S."</I>

</p><p>Founded by Sucheng Chan in 1991, the <I>Asian American History and Culture</I>, series has sponsored innovative scholarship that has redefined, expanded, and advanced the field of Asian American studies while strengthening its links to related areas of scholarly inquiry and engaged critique. Like the field from which it emerged, the series remains rooted in the social sciences and humanities, encompassing multiple regions, formations, communities, and identities. Extending the vision of founding editor Sucheng Chan and emeriti editor Michael Omi and David Palumbo-Liu, series editors K. Scott Wong, Linda Trinh V�, and Cathy Schlund-Vials continue to develop a foundational collection that embodies a range of theoretical and methodological approaches to Asian American studies.</p>
