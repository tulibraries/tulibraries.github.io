Keating's data also point up our urgent need to focus public policy on depopulated and increasingly impoverished and homogeneous urban centers. As he convincingly demonstrates, private and government attempts at suburban integration, as well as special urban integrationist projects, have achieved spotty results at best."</I>
<br>&#151<b><I>Publishers Weekly</I></b><I></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><p>Whether through affirmative housing policies or mandatory legislation, there have been numerous efforts to integrate America's neighborhoods, especially the historically white, affluent suburbs.  Though much of suburbia has rejected such measures out of a fear of losing their communities to an influx of low-income, inner-city, and primarily African American residents, several metropolitan areas have been successful in creating greater racial diversity.  W. Dennis Keating documents the desirability, feasibility, and legality of implementing housing diversity policies in the suburbs.

<p>At the heart of this book is the troubling dilemma that the private housing market will inevitably resist race-conscious policies that can be effective only if embraced and supported by individual home buyers and renters, politicians, realtors, financial institutions, and insurers.  In the Cleveland, Ohio, metropolitan area, pro-integrative policies have resulted in some examples of long-term racial diversity, particularly in Cleveland Heights and Shaker Heights.

<p>Keating compares Cleveland's suburbs to suburbs around the country that have both failed and succeeded in reducing housing discrimination.  While there have been occasional fair housing  victories over the last three decades, Keating's analysis points toward strategies for greater progress in the future.</p>
