<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>"A passionately argued, provocative book that takes us back to the long neglected emphasis on the cities that was so distinctive a part of the original War On Poverty. But now, at issue is the city of the 21st century."</I>

<p>"Economic and political forces no longer combat poverty&#151they generate poverty!" exclaim William Goldsmith and Edward Blakely in their report on the plight of American's urban poor.  Focusing on the reality of separation&#151social segmentation, economic inequality, and geographic isolation&#151the authors examine the presence and persistence of urban poverty, the transformation of national industry into a global economy, and the dilemmas of local reform.  Goldsmith and Blakely document the appalling conditions of poor and minority people in central cities, examining those conditions in relation to inequalities in the national distributions of income and wealth.  They analyze the connections between the structure and movement of the new global economy and the problems of the poorest Americans.  They demonstrate how globalized markets and production arrangements have worsened the opportunities facing most American cities and workers.  Noting that neither economic growth nor public subsidy has solved the problems of the poor, Goldsmith and Blakely propose that the very separation that exacerbates poverty be used to motive restructure.

<p>The authors maintain that when those in power locally respond to the pressure exerted by those suffering from inequality and isolation, community-level institutions will be restructured.  These multi-local coalitions of small businesses and neighborhood organizations need to press for reallocation of federal resources in favor of domestic needs and redirection of the national economic favor of workers and common citizens.

<P><p><I>"This is a major work that will influence debate on the issue of American urban poverty into the next century.  The authors argue that the recent upsurge in urban poverty has been generated by a particular set of American political responses to changes in the international and national economies, exacerbated by a long process of federally subsidized suburbanization and by racial discrimination.  The difference [from Wilson's </I>the Truly Disadvantaged<I>] is that Goldsmith and Blakely's policy recommendations are more comprehensive and have a greater focus on strategies 'from the bottom up.'"</I>

<p><I>"Goldsmith and Blakely present a vivid, factually accurate account of the post-1970s rise in inequality, underemployment, poverty, and collapsing societal infrastructures.  Having outlined the dimensions of national disaster, they do not give up hope.  Rather, they advocate the improved industrial policy, expanded opportunity for education, and increased family support.... Their provocative optimism, although guarded, is a refreshing challenge, much needed in this period of pessimism and cynicism."</I>
