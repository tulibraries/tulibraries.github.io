</P><BLOCKQUOTE><I><p>"Nature in Common?<i> brings together leading environmental philosophers
to sharpen and clarify the divisions and critically examine the strengths
and limits of moving environmentalists toward an agenda with which most
can agree. This is an important and unique collection of essays [and]
deserves to be read widely."</i><BR>&#151<b>Jan Dizard</b>, Charles Hamilton Houston Professor of American
Culture and the Pick Professor of Environmental Studies,
Amherst College</p></I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>This important book brings together leading environmental thinkers
to debate a central conflict within environmental philosophy: Should
we appreciate nature mainly for its ability to advance our interests or
should we respect it as having a good of its own, apart from any
contribution to human well being? Specifically, the fourteen essays
collected here discuss the "convergence hypothesis" put forth by
Bryan Norton&#151a controversial thesis in environmental ethics about
the policy implications of moral arguments for environmental
protection. Historically influential essays are joined with newly
commissioned essays to provide the first sustained attempt to
reconcile two long-opposed positions. Norton himself offers the
book's closing essay.</p>

<p>This seminal volume contains contributions from some of the
most respected scholars in the field, including Donald Brown,
J. Baird Callicott, Andrew Light, Holmes Rolston III, Laura Westra,
and many others. Although <i>Nature in Common?</i> will be especially
useful for students and professionals studying environmental ethics
and philosophy, it will engage any reader who is concerned about
the philosophies underlying contemporary environmental policies.</p>

<BR>&nbsp;<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p><i>"</i>Nature in Common?<i> is a pivotal contribution to the field of environmental ethics as it grapples with the means and modes of making more significant impacts on local, national, or international environmental policy and decision making. For anyone interested in the subject, Minteer provides a balanced and well organized selection of the most influential thinkers who have long been hashing out the terms of debate for environmental ethics since the 1970s. This book is a necessary read for students in environmental ethics and policy."</i><br>&#151<b><i>The Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics</i></b>

<p><i>"Ben Minteer has done the environmental community a great service by bringing together an excellent collection of essays.... Besides being a valuable resource for established environmental ethicists, the volume would contribute nicely to advanced undergraduate or graduate courses, especially if they include policy-oriented students.... We can thank Minteer for putting together an excellent anthology...that may ultimately contribute to greater convergence among environmentalists around the cogency of the convergence hypothesis."</i><br>&#151<b><i>Environmental Ethics</i></b>
