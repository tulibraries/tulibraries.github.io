<p>Reformers argue that public financing of campaigns will help rescue American democracy from the corruptive influence of money in elections. <em>Public Financing in American Elections</em> evaluates this claim in an effort to remove the guesswork from the discussion about public finance.</p>

<p>Featuring some of the most senior scholars in political science and electoral studies, this book provides an up-to-date treatment of research and thinking about public campaign finance reforms. Exploring proposals at the local, state, and federal levels, the contributors provide a comprehensive overview of public financing initiatives in the United States and an examination of their impact. Also included are focused analyses of various existing public programs.</p>

<P><p><I>�This collection makes a valuable contribution to the debate over public financing of elections in the United States. It covers changes in the presidential public financing system but also reviews state and municipal public financing systems along with the prospects for public funding of congressional campaigns and public opinion on the topic. Few books investigate this range of public financing systems and their effects on politics.�</I><br>&#151<b>John Green</b>, Distinguished Professor of Political Science and Director of the Ray C. Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at the University of Akron

<p><i>"The articles valuably describe the range of, and considerable variation among, the programs currently in existence. Remarkably, few of the programs have ever before been evaluated for efficacy....[A] valuable snapshot of this obscure policy area. Summing Up: Recommended." </i> <br>&#151<b><i>Choice</i></b></p>
