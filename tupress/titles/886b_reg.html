<p>The second volume in the American Historical Association's series introduces readers to the cross-cultural study of ancient and classical civilizations.  The opening essay by Jerry Bentley surveys methodologies and critical interpretations that have been essential to the development of comparative historical analysis.  These include contributions from the fields of sociology, archaeology, linguistics, anthropology, and recent investigative practices that honor previously neglected groups and validate testimony passed down through oral traditions.  The first set of essays highlight predominant themes in global history by examining the ongoing interactions between ancient agrarian and nomadic societies as well as the impact of these exchanges on economic development and cross-cultural adaptation.  The essays in the second section focus on regional patterns in the dissemination of ideas, institutions, and material culture.

<p>By highlighting key historical transitions and recurring cultural patterns, this book provides an engaging introduction to the complexities of human development.  Written by leading scholars in the field, the historiographic essays in <I>Agricultural and Pastoral Societies in Ancient and Classical History</I> offer students and teachers a comprehensive overview of the arguments, applications, and resources that inform comparative global history.

</p><p><i>Critical Perspectives on the Past</i>, edited by Susan Porter Benson, Stephen Brier, and Roy Rosenzweig, is concerned with the traditional and nontraditional ways in which historical ideas are formed.  In its attentiveness to issues of race, class, and gender and to the role of human agency in shaping events, the series is as critical of traditional historical method as content.  Emphasizing that history is itself an interpretation of material events, the series demonstrates that the historian's choices of subject, narrative technique, and documentation are politically as well as intellectually constructed.</p>
