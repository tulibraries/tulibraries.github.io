<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>"What does it take for the constituents of education&#151teachers, students, parents, administrators, and, above all, the culture of the school&#151to work together synergistically?  To find out, read this distillation of Seymour Sarason's fifty years of reflections&#151always challenging, often wise."</I>
<br>&#151<b>Howard Gardner</b>, author of <I>Good Work: When Excellence and Ethics Meet</I><I></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Seymour Sarason, in the words of Carl Glickman, is "one of America's seminal thinkers about public education." For over four decades his has been a voice of much-needed skepticism about our plans for school reform, teacher training, and educational psychology. Now, for the first time, Sarason's essential writings on these and other issues are collected together, offering student and researcher alike with the range, depth, and originality of Sarason's contributions to American thinking on schooling.

<p>As we go from debate to debate on issues such as school choice, charter schools, inclusive education, national standards, and other problems that seem to drag on without solution, Sarason's critical stance on the folly of many of our attempts to fix schools has always had at the center a concern for the main players in our educational institutions: the students, the teachers and the parents. Any plans that cannot account for their well-being are doomed to failure. And in the face of such failure, the clarity of Sarason's vision for real educational success is a much-needed antidote to much of the rhetoric that currently passes for substantial debate.

<p>A wide-ranging and comprehensive selection of Sarason's most significant writings, <I>The Skeptical Visionary</I> should find a prized space on any student's or teacher's bookshelf.

<P><p><I>"Every time I'm getting too cocky, and think I've got 'the answer,' I  read and reread Sarason. He pricks my conscience, but in such a delightful way that I go back for more.  He goads me into thinking deeper, and being a bit more honest with myself. I find myself always wanting to argue back, wiggle out a bit, build a roadblock to his devastating logic. Of course, that's what Sarason's after&#151and it works. This collection puts together most of my favorites and it invites a new generation of readers to become skeptical idealists, in the best and most necessary sense of that phrase."</I>
<br>&#151<b>Deborah Meier</b>, author of <I>The Power of Their Ideas: Lessons for America from a Small School in Harlem</I>

<p><I>"</I>The Skeptical Visionary<I> is an indispensable guide to understanding one of the most thoughtful education thinkers of the 20th century&#151a must-read for practitioners and policymakers alike. Fried's introductory essay provides a concise and illuminating framework for viewing the work of Sarason. This work is an invaluable contribution to the literature of school reform."</I>
<br>&#151<b>Tony Wagner</b>, Co-Director, Change Leadership Group, Harvard University, Graduate School of Education, and author of <I>Making the Grade: Reinventing America's Schools</I>

<i><p>"Fried has judiciously selected 24 essays written over a 40-year period.... The approach provides both a coherence and a context for Sarason's wide-ranging intellect and results in a rich and deep appreciation of one of the most influential minds in modern psychology."</i>
