</P><BLOCKQUOTE><I>"The diversity of contributions—from historians, political scientists, sociologists, and a pollster—distinguish </i>The American Dream in the 21st Century<i> from many other books on the topic. The multi-disciplinary focus is especially useful, as chapters provide cultural interpretations of Americans’ attitudes toward the American Dream through the lenses of race, gender, religion and ethics."</I>
<BR>&#151<B>Arne L. Kalleberg</B>, Kenan Distinguished Professor of Sociology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>The American Dream has long been a dominant theme in U.S. culture, one with enduring significance, but these are difficult times for dreamers. The editors of and contributors to <em>The American Dream in the 21st Century</em> examine the American Dream historically, socially, and economically and consider its intersection with politics, religion, race, gender, and generation. </p>

<p>The conclusions presented in this short, readable volume provide both optimism for the faith that most Americans have in the possibility of achieving the American Dream and a realistic assessment of the cracks in the dream. The last presidential election offered hope, but the experts here warn about the need for better programs and policies that could make the dream a reality for a larger number of Americans.

<BR>&nbsp;<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p><i>"</i>The American Dream in the 21st Century<i> is an engaging look at the transformations the American Dream has experienced and how they have evolved—from private vs. public, to material vs. spiritual. The editors wisely realize that the dream has changed, not disappeared or died. This book is a worthwhile read for anyone interested in a detailed view of how these changes fit into the history of the American Dream and a look into potential futures."</i>
<br>&#151<b>Maria Alejandra Quijada</b>, Assistant Professor, Loyola Marymount University College of Business

<p><i> "This collection of essays addresses the question of how the American dream helps maintain a stable society into the 21st century, despite the fact that the dream is (and always has been) inaccessible to a large percentage of the population, perhaps a majority.... The authors point out how the dream builds a patriotic sense that the US is unique and superior, and anyone who suggests otherwise risks isolation. A politician who questions the dream may be committing career suicide. Summing Up: Recommended."</i> <br>&#151<b><i>Choice</i></b>
