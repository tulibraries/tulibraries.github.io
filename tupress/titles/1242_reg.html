</P><BLOCKQUOTE><I>"This is a period of change and challenge for our science and technology enterprise. This book provides invaluable insight into the origins of that change and examines ways to turn the challenge into opportunity. For those seeking fresh perspectives on modern science policy, </I>Frontiers of Illusion <I>should be a part of your library. For those in the science and technology community seeking to survive these tumultuous times, </I>Frontiers of Illusion <I>is essential reading."</I>
<br>&#151<B>Congressman George E. Brown, Jr.</B><I></I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>For the past fifty years, science and technology&#151supported with billions of dollars from the U.S. government&#151have advanced at a rate that would once have seemed miraculous, while society's problems have grown more intractable, complex, and diverse. Yet scientists and politicians alike continue to prescribe more science and more technology to cure such afflictions as global climate change, natural resource depletion, overpopulation, inadequate health care, weapons proliferation, and economic inequality.

<p>Daniel Sarewitz scrutinizes the fundamental myths that have guided the formulation of science policy for half a century&#151myths that serve the professional and political interests of the scientific community, but often fail to advance the interests of society as a whole. His analysis ultimately demonstrates that stronger linkages between progress in science and progress in society will require research agendas that emerge not from the intellectual momentum of science, but from the needs and goals of society.

<BR>&nbsp;<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p><I>"Daniel Sarewitz has written a well-informed and incisive description and analysis of the mythos by which science policy is guided, and has shown how these self-serving illusions limit and distort the contributions of scientists to the common good.  Highly recommended!"</I>
<br>&#151<b>Herman E. Daly</b>, School of Public Affairs, University of Maryland, author of <I>Steady-State Economics</I>

<p><i>"...Sarewitz's book, which is clearly written and cogently argued, will be useful to specialists as a thought-provoking, if not historically textured, treatise on postwar science policy and to students as an introduction to some of the major issues in the recent debate on the topic."</i>
