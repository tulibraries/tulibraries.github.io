<br>&#151<b><I>New Directions For Women</I></b><I></I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>This volume gives the first in-depth look at the sizeable population of women who are domestic workers in Latin America and the Caribbean. Twenty-two essays document how these women have begun to struggle for recognition of their social role in the family unit, for the right to organize, and for the legislation and programs already won by other members of the working class. They have decided to be "muchachas"&#151"girls"&#151no more, but rather household workers, women with a profession.
<BR>&nbsp;<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p><I>"A number of pieces in the volume make major theoretical contributions to our understanding of the politics which surround household labor, many afford an insightful glimpse into the world view of domestics and several clarify the tensions in the feminist movement over the issue of domestic service.  By covering a range of countries and engaging Latin American scholars in the their enterprise, the editors have constructed a volume that will have broad appeal."</I>
<br>&#151<b>Susan C. Bourque</b>, Professor of Government, Director of the Project on Women and Social Change, Smith College

<p><I>"This is the most impressive collection of case material to date on this segment, approximately 20 percent of the female work force in Latin America.  The 22 essays from academics and activists, North and South, range from issues of history, ideology, and feminism to discrete country and organizational cases and individual testimonies....  The work will have many applications both academic and practical."</I>
