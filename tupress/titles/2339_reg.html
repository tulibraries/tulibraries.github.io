<BLOCKQUOTE><I>"The editors have assembled an impressive set of internationally known scholars of social movements to address the central problems of transitions from authoritarian regimes. The geographical scope of the collection is extraordinary, and the book’s unusually high level of coherence lends important value to the individual papers. </I>Movements in Times of Democratic Transition<I> is a timely book, and its many analyses provide a broad and deep set of theoretical tools for assessing transitions. I do not know of another such comprehensive treatment of the potential trajectories of social movement actors than these collected essays."</i><br>&#151<b>John D. McCarthy</b>, Distinguished Professor of Sociology at the Pennsylvania State University</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In regions that have undergone tumultuous transitions, democratic social movements have often been the catalyst for great change. However, once those changes occur, can these movements survive, and if so, how? 

<P>The editors and contributors to <I>Movements in Times of Democratic Transition</I> examine in comparative detail how social movements act within the context of the democratic transitions they have been fighting for, and how they are affected by the changes they helped bring about. Offering insights into the nature of how social movements decline, radicalize, revitalize, or spark new cycles of activism, <I>Movements in Times of Democratic Transition</I> provides a comprehensive analysis of these key questions of mobilization research.

<BR>&nbsp;<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p><i>"This fascinating collection of articles on social movements in times of democratic transition makes a significant contribution to the field.... The authors raise crucial issues social movement organizations experience in Brazil, Argentina, El Salvador, South Africa, and Poland. In each instance, the authors demonstrate that the particular history of a successful social movement shapes and conditions its interaction with the new government. This volume has much to teach social movement researchers and does a superb job of framing the issues. Summing Up: Essential."</i><br>&#151<b><i>Choice</i></b>

<p><i>"[A] valuable collection of research articles by noted experts who provide evidence for movement radicalization, revitalization, abeyance, and disengagement. The book is rich in theory and in methods—various chapters report on both qualitative and quantitative methods—as well as thick descriptions of particular cases. Well organized and well edited.... this volume offers invaluable insights."</i> <br>&#151<b><i>Contemporary Sociology</i></b>
