</P><BLOCKQUOTE><I>"[This] does more to clarify what schools actually do, and why most American research on education leaves us with our myths about schooling intact, than anything that has been published in America."</I>
<br>&#151<b>Edgar Z. Friedenberg</b>, Dalhousie University<I></I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Over the past decade there has been much theoretical work on the relationship between schooling and economic and cultural reproduction.  A good deal of this research has remained outside the school, not going inside to examine the actual curriculum and teaching practices that go on every day in the classroom.
<P><I>Ideology and Practice in Schooling</I> brings together investigations of the content and organization of the curriculum and the experience of teachers and students in schools.  Included are ideological analyses of history, art, literature, economics, and science curricula, as well as ethnographic studies of the lived culture of student oppositional practices, changes in the control of teachers' work, the experience of minority students at community colleges, of girls in a secretarial training program, and of children in primary schools.  Each original essay blends together recent work on the nature of the relationship between society and education with an in-depth examination of the internal practices of schooling, and also points out where there are possibilities for emancipatory educational action.

<BR>&nbsp;<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p><I>"[A] significant contribution to an important growing body of radical literature on education that can provide interested educators with a deeper understanding of the linkages between theory and practice and with a better sense of how classroom practices aid in the production and reproduction of social classes."</I>
