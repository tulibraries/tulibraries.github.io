<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p><i>"In tracing the evolving production of images designed to confirm Cleveland's continued vitality in spite of the urban crisis that enveloped it in the mid-twentieth century, J. Mark Souther unveils the complex relationship between revitalization and decline. By penetrating the unified fa&ccedil;ade of the city's growth coalition, he reveals how competing approaches and contested perceptions complicated both recovery and public confidence in its success. </i>Believing in Cleveland <i> tests our understanding of how urban stakeholders reacted to decline and offers considerable insight into the perils of addressing revitalization in an important Rust Belt city."<br/></i>
&#8212;<b>Howard Gillette Jr., </b>Professor Emeritus of History, Rutgers University, and author of <i>Camden after the Fall: Decline and Renewal in a Post-industrial City</i><br>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><p>Detractors have called it "The Mistake on the Lake." It was once America's "Comeback City." According to author J. Mark Souther, Cleveland has long sought to defeat its perceived civic malaise. <i>Believing in Cleveland </i>chronicles how city leaders used imagery and rhetoric to combat and, at times, accommodate urban and economic decline.<br/><br/>
Souther explores Cleveland's downtown revitalization efforts, its neighborhood renewal and restoration projects, and its fight against deindustrialization. He shows how the city reshaped its image when it was bolstered by sports team victories. But Cleveland was not always on the upswing. Souther places the city's history in the postwar context when the city and metropolitan area were divided by uneven growth. In the 1970s, the city-suburb division was wider than ever. <br/><br/> 
<i>Believing in Cleveland </i>recounts the long, difficult history of a city that entered the postwar period as America's sixth largest, then lost ground during a period of robust national growth. But rather than tell a tale of decline, Souther provides a fascinating story of resilience for what some folks called "The Best Location in the Nation."<br>

<p><em>"</em>Believing in Cleveland <em> makes an important contribution to urban policy scholarship. Instead of starkly alternating accounts of revitalization or decline, Souther shows that decline and resurgence have always coexisted in post-World War II metropolitan life. By including the downtown, residential neighborhoods, and industry in the same history&#8212;one that foregrounds citizens' best and worst efforts on behalf of their entire metropolis&#8212;this book upends clich&#233;s of monolithic, hollow boosterism and an artificial center/suburb divide. Cleveland offers a powerful story in its own right, but most U.S. cities will see themselves reflected in this illuminating mirror.</em>"<br>
  &#8212;<strong>Alison Isenberg, </strong>Professor of History, Princeton University, and author of <em>Designing San Francisco: Art, Land, and Urban Renewal in the City by the Bay</em><br>
</p>
<p>"Believing in Cleveland <i> is a powerful antidote to the simplistic, unidirectional narrative of decline that too often attends accounts of Rust Belt cities. Souther deftly interlaces stories of urban decay and revitalization, civic pessimism and optimism, despair over past mistakes and hope for a brighter future. Best of all, Souther traces these stories through real material spaces of the city. In the process, we see a wide range of actors at work and a city constantly grappling with its status in an urban nation. In this way, Believing in Cleveland sets a new standard for how we tell the story of postwar urban governance, municipal policy, and community development&#8212;a story where the richly layered interests of real people manifest in the streets, parks, plazas, and homes of the city."<br/></i>&#8212;<b>Joseph Heathcott,</b> Associate Professor of Urban Studies, The New School, and co-author (with Angela Dietz) of <i>Capturing the City: Photographs from the Streets of St. Louis, 1900&#8211;1930</i><br>
