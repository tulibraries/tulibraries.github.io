Stepping firmly into a notorious minefield of ethnic/religious passions, Adam and Moodley argue convincingly that hoping for some savior figure to bring the warring parties together is futile. For the uncompromising quality of their political analysis, and for the tough realism of the advice they offer, they are to be applauded."</i>
<br>&#151<b>J.M. Coetzee</b><i></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><p>The ongoing violence, despair and paralysis among Israelis and Palestinians resemble the gloomy period in South Africa during the late 1980s. Heribert Adam and Kogila Moodley show that these analogies with South Africa can be applied to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for two purposes: to showcase South Africa as an inspiring model for a negotiated settlement and to label Israel a "colonial settler state" that should be confronted with strategies (sanctions, boycotts) similar to those applied against the apartheid regime. Because of the different historical and socio-political contexts, both assumptions are problematic. Whereas peacemaking resulted in an inclusive democracy in South Africa, the favored solution for Israel and the West Bank is territorial separation into two states.

<p>Adam and Moodley speculate on what would have happened in the Middle East had there been what they call "a Palestinian Mandela" providing unifying moral and strategic leadership in the ethnic conflict. A timely, relevant look at the issues of a polarized struggle, <i>Seeking Mandela</i> is an original comparison of South Africa and Israel, as well as an important critique on the nature of comparative politics.</p>

<p><i>�Two leading specialists on South Africa, who, for some forty years, have closely studied the evolution of racial conflicts and their resolution in that country, now turn to the question of how much of the South African experience is applicable to the perennial Israel � Palestine conflict. They criticize any facile analogy between South Africa and Israel as �fascist,� �racist,� or �apartheid� societies, and give us a nuanced analysis of similarities and differences between them, with emphasis on the latter.�</i>
