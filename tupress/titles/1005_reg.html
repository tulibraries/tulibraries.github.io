<p><I>Why Women are Oppressed</I> offers a much-needed radical feminist perspective on the "political conditions of sexual love." Recognizing that "sexual life always exists in definite socioeconomic contexts," Anna G. Jónasdóttir develops a theory that elucidates the question: Why does men's social and political power persist even in Western societies where women have socioeconomic equality?

<p>Throughout, Jónasdóttir gives empirical relevance to her theorizing.  She cites situations in various spheres of society where men and women compete and where men come out as "winners" for no obvious reason other than their malehood.  Her account of women as loving caretakers "for" men, rather than desiring, interested subjects in reciprocally erotic relations stirs debate about women's needs and interests.
