<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>"Rich Westcott has done a fine job of researching and compiling the history of [special] major league pitchers of the last 120 years. He not only makes modern day fans aware that there are only a small number of 300-win pitchers to have played the game, but also the trials and tribulations as well as the strengths needed to accomplish this great feat."</I>
<br>&#151<b>Paul Owens</b>, senior advisor to the general manager, Philadelphia Phillies<I></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Since the beginning of major league baseball, more than 12,000 pitchers have thrown from the mound.  Of them, only twenty have reached the ultimate goal of their profession: to be a 300-game winner.

<p>Rich Westcott, celebrated sports historian and journalist, offers in <I>Winningest Pitchers</I> profiles of each of those twenty pitchers, including Cy Young, Gaylord Perry, and Nolan Ryan. In small biographies, photographs, and stats, we gain a full picture of each of these rare players whose combined greatness contributes to baseball's continued importance to American athletic life.
