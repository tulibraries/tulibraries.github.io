“<i>Using a magnifying lens to study immigrant bashing in his hometown, Jamie Longazel brings into sharp focus the anti-Latino racism at the heart of national politics today. Even as we as a society struggle to build solidarity across racial divisions, powerful forces seek advantage in tearing us farther apart. The concentrated focus&nbsp;of&nbsp;</i>Undocumented Fears<i> helps us understand not only why this occurs but also how we might help replace fear with friendship, social division with a sense of shared humanity.</i>”—<b>Ian F. Haney López</b>, John H. Boalt Professor of Law, University of California–Berkeley, and author of <i>Dog Whistle Politics: How Coded Racial Appeals Have Reinvented Racism and Wrecked the Middle Class

The Illegal Immigration Relief Act (IIRA), passed in the small Rustbelt city of Hazleton, Pennsylvania in 2006, was a local ordinance that laid out penalties for renting to or hiring undocumented immigrants and declared English the city’s official language. The notorious IIRA gained national prominence and kicked off a parade of local and state-level legislative initiatives designed to crack down on undocumented immigrants. <br>
<p>In his cogent and timely book, <i>Undocumented</i> <i>Fears</i>, Jamie Longazel uses the debate around Hazleton’s controversial ordinance as a case study that reveals the mechanics of contemporary divide and conquer politics. He shows how neoliberal ideology, misconceptions about Latina/o immigrants, and nostalgic imagery of “Small Town, America” led to a racialized account of an undocumented immigrant “invasion,” masking the real story of a city beset by large-scale loss of manufacturing jobs.<br>
<p>Offering an up-close look at how the local debate unfolded in the city that set off this broader trend, <i>Undocumented Fears</i> makes an important connection between immigration politics and the perpetuation of racial and economic inequality.

<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p>
“Undocumented Fears <i>offers an incredibly rich and insightful analysis of how the political dynamics in a struggling former coal mining town resulted in its becoming ground zero in the raging national debate over immigration. Longazel provides a bird’s-eye view of the politics—racial and otherwise—that led Hazleton, Pennsylvania, to enact laws designed to punish undocumented immigrants, with Latino migrants in the crosshairs.&nbsp;The clash of Latino immigrants with the ‘small town America’ ideal is a gripping story that deserves the scholarly attention offered by Longazel.&nbsp;As some might say after reading</i>&nbsp;Undocumented Fears, <i>‘Only in America.’”</i>—<b>Kevin Johnson</b>, Dean and Mabie-Apallas Professor of Public Interest Law and Chicana/o Studies, University of California–Davis School of Law, and author of <i>The “Huddled Masses” Myth: Immigration and Civil Rights  </i><b>
