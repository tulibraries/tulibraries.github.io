<P><p>This collection of original essays discusses the increasingly rapid spread of AIDS among women, considering the varying experiences and responses of women of color, lesbians, and economically impoverished women. The essays range widely from policy assessments to case studies, focusing on women as sufferers, caretakers, policy activists, community organizers, and educators.</p>
<BR><H2 class="inpageheading">Reviews</h2><p>
<p><I>"Finally!  This book doesn't just repeat well-known data about women and AIDS or stop at flagging the inextricable connection between women's social roles, status, and rights and their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS&#151it deals directly with how to make a difference.  The editors have made a major contribution to global learning&#151by providing examples from the United States and around the world which speak directly and honestly about successes and failures.  This book signals the long-awaited and critically important linkage between feminist strategies and action for HIV/AIDS prevention and care.  Through its accounts of struggle and action, this book sharply illustrates the fundamental linkage between human rights and health.  Many this book catalyze women and men of courage and conscience!"</I>

<p><I>"Schneider and Stoller have provided an invaluable resource to researchers and policymakers who often overlook the impact of AIDS on women and women of color in particular.  This collection documents and analyzes women's experiences with AIDS, always pointing to the centrality of gender in understanding AIDS.  Drawing on analyses of sexuality, law, public policy, public health, and sociology, these essays fill and important void in our knowledge of this important social problem."</I>
