<h3 class="author">James P. Gray</h3>
<p>Veteran trial judge and former federal prosecutor Judge James P. Gray believes drug prohibition remains one of our country's biggest failed policies. In this updated edition of his bestseller, <i>Why Our Drug Laws Have Failed and What Can We Do About It</i>, Judge Gray provides startling information about drug-related crimes&#8212;from escalating incarceration rates to drug-related kidnappings. Judge Gray also examines the latest experiments in drug legalization. The thirteen states that have adopted medical marijuana have seen a reduction of crime and an increase in revenue. 

<p>Judge Gray explains how and why we need to take the profit out of the drug trade. There are viable options at work in other countries&#8212;Portugal saw a drop of 50 percent in drug usage for problem users after decriminalization, as well as a drop in children's drug use!

<p>This incendiary book will anger readers, but it also provides hope. We can solve some of our medical and social problems&#8212;by repealing our failed drug laws.

<P><p>PRAISE FOR THE FIRST EDITION

<p><i>"Here's a scathing jeremiad against the war on drugs, notable both for the author's position and for the sustained anger of its argument."</I>
<br>&#151<b><I>Publishers Weekly</I></b> (starred review)

<p><I>"Judge Gray's thorough and scholarly work, based as it is on his personal experience, should help considerably to improve our impossible drug laws.  [His] book drives a stake through the heart of the failed War on Drugs and gives us options to hope for in the battles to come."</I>
<br>&#151<b>Walter Cronkite</b>

<p><I>"James P. Gray,a [retired] California Superior Court judge and a former Republican congressional candidate, has written perhaps the most convincing indictment ever that the war on drugs can never be won. ...Gray's careful, sobering book provides grounds for taking a fresh look at our national drug policies."</I>
