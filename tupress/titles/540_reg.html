<p>This comprehensive review of the public system of occupational education and job training for women in the United States is the first book of its kind. Placing the treatment of women in an historical and political context, these original essays focus on education and training for occupations that require less than a four-year college degree. These include clerical, service, and blue-collar occupations where the overwhelming majority of today�s working women earn their living. The contributors examine the major public training programs that are aimed at people who are entering the labor market for the first time as well as those offered to workers of all ages who need employment assistance.
