</P><P>This collection of evocative personal testimonies by three generations of Hmong refugees is the first to describe their lives in Laos as slash-and-burn farmers, as refugees after a Communist government came to power in 1975, and as immigrants in the United States.  Reflecting on the homes left behind, their narratives chronicle the difficulties of forging a new identity.

<P>From Jou Yee Xiong's Life Story:
<BR><I>"I stopped teaching my sons many of the Hmong ways because I felt my ancestors and I had suffered enough already.  I thought that teaching my children the old ways would only place a burden on them."</I>

<P>From Ka Pao Xiong's (Jou Yee Xiong's son) Life Story:
<BR><I>"It has been very difficult for us to adapt because we had no professions or trades and we suffered from culture shock.  Here in America, both the husband and wife must work simultaneously to earn enough money to live on.  Many of our children are ignorant of the Hmong way of life&#133.  Even the old people are forgetting about their life in Laos, as they enjoy the prosperity and good life in America."</I>

<P>From Xang Mao Xiong's Life Story:
<BR><I>"When the Communists took over Laos and General Vang Pao fled with his family, we, too, decided to leave.  Not only my family, but thousands of Hmong tried to flee.  I rented a car for thirty thousand Laotian dollars, and it took us to Nasu&#133.  We felt compelled to leave because many of us had been connected to the CIA&#133.  Thousands of Hmong were traveling on foot.  Along the way, many of them were shot and killed by Communist soldiers.  We witnessed a bloody massacre of civilians."</I>

<P>From Vue Vang's Life Story:
<BR><I>"Life was so hard in the [Thai refugee] camp that when we found out we could go to the United States, we did not hesitate to grasp the chance.  We knew that were we to remain in the camp, there would be no hope for a better future.  We would not be able to offer our children anything better than a life of perpetual poverty and anguish."</I>

Scott Wong, Linda Trinh V�, and Cathy Schlund-Vials.
</p><p>Founded by Sucheng Chan in 1991, the <I>Asian American History and Culture</I>, series has sponsored innovative scholarship that has redefined, expanded, and advanced the field of Asian American studies while strengthening its links to related areas of scholarly inquiry and engaged critique. Like the field from which it emerged, the series remains rooted in the social sciences and humanities, encompassing multiple regions, formations, communities, and identities. Extending the vision of founding editor Sucheng Chan and emeriti editor Michael Omi and David Palumbo-Liu, series editors K. Scott Wong, Linda Trinh V�, and Cathy Schlund-Vials continue to develop a foundational collection that embodies a range of theoretical and methodological approaches to Asian American studies.</p>
