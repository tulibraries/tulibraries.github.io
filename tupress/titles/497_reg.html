<p>More than just a history of a musical genre, <I>Looking Up at Down</I> traces the evolution of the various strands of blues music within the broader context of the culture on which it commented, and discusses its importance as a form of cultural resistance and identity for Afro-Americans. William Barlow explores the lyrics, describes the musical styles, and portrays the musicians and performers who created this uniquely American music. He describes how the blues sound&#151with its recognizable dissonance and African musical standards&#151and the blues text, which provided a bottom up view of American society, became bulwarks of cultural resistance. 

<p>Using rare recordings, oral histories, and interviews, Barlow analyzes how the blues was sustained as a form of Afro-American cultural resistance despite attempts by the dominant culture to assimilate and commercialize the music and exploit its artists.
<BR>&nbsp;<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p><I>"A masterwork.... [Barlow] includes all types of blues in his analysis, without losing sight of the music�s density, its humor, and its satire, when the blues get so bad that we are 'lookin� up at down.'"</I>
<br>&#151<b>Ruth A. Banes</b>, <I>Popular Music and Society</I>

<p><I>"Bill Barlow�s fine study is a major contribution to our understanding of blues. He carefully traces the music from its roots in the rural South to urban traditions in Memphis, St. Louis, and Chicago. Barlow�s broad portrait of the blues and his perceptive analysis make this study a classic."</I>
<br>&#151<b>Bill Ferris</b>, Director, Center for the Study of Southern Culture, The University of Mississippi

<p><I>"...encyclopedic..."</I>
<br>&#151<b><I>Publishers Weekly</I></b>

<p><I>"...a definitive work on black culture. The major value of the book is its exhaustive scope and its demonstration that blues continues African culture in America under new conditions. A rare jewel in the scholarship of Afro-American culture."</I>
<br>&#151<b>Sterling D. Plumpp</b>, University of Illinois at Chicago
