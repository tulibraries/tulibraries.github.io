</P><P>Anyone who has sat at the "Vet," watched a pick-up game, or played catch in the yard, knows that sports is more than a game in Philadelphia&#8212;it's a commitment to hard work, a belief in community values, and a tradition of never giving up. 

<P>Told through the personal experiences of professional athletes, community leaders, and everyday players, <i>More Than a Game</i> captures how sports build character and communities with each hit of the ball, catch of a touchdown pass, or dunk of the basketball. 

<P>Among those featured are Carlos Ruiz, Chris Pronger, Sonny Hill, Angelo Cataldi, Leonard Weaver, Tina Sloan Green, Ruben Amaro, Jr., Joe Banner, Alyson Goodner, Gary Cobb, Jim Ellis, Mayor Michael Nutter, Nicholas Bradley, Governor Edward Rendell, and Rami Ibrahim. 

<P>The perfect gift for the aspiring athlete, the community coach, or the supportive parent.
